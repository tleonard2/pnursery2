<h2>Facts: Callicarpa</h2>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Verbenaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Callicarpa (cal-i-CAR-puh) – In Greek kallos means beauty, carpos means fruit.</p>
<p><strong>Common:</strong> Beautyberry</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to tropics and subtropics from Asia, Australia, North & Central America. Characteristics: Small white, red or purple flowers in clusters followed by round brightly colored berries.</p>
<p>Green leaves are opposite, sometimes hairy and turn gold & purple before falling in autumn.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> In their native habitats, some Callicarpa can grow to be trees. The varieties that grow in Portland stay considerably smaller, growing to between 4-10' tall & 4-10' wide depending on the variety.</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Plant in full sun for optimum fruit production & fall color - part shade is okay but it will inhibit berry production. Grows best in well-drained soil.</p>
<p><strong>Problems:</strong> Mostly trouble free with the possibility of minor leaf spot. Callicarpa can get rangy over time – rejuvenate by pruning low to the ground in late winter (like you do your roses). Flowers are produced on new growth, so you won't miss out on winter berries.</p>
