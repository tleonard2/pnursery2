                        <h2>Facts: Callicarpa</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Verbenaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Callicarpa (cal-i-CAR-puh) &ndash; In Greek kallos means beauty, carpos means fruit.</p>

                        <p><strong>Common:</strong> Beautyberry</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to tropics and subtropics from Asia, Australia, North &amp; Central America. Characteristics: Small white, red or purple flowers in clusters followed by round brightly colored berries.</p>

                        <p>Green leaves are opposite, sometimes hairy and turn gold &amp; purple before falling in autumn.</p>

                        <p><strong>Size:</strong> In their native habitats, some Callicarpa can grow to be trees. The varieties that grow in Portland stay considerably smaller, growing to between 4-10' tall &amp; 4-10' wide depending on the variety.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Plant in full sun for optimum fruit production &amp; fall color - part shade is okay but it will inhibit berry production. Grows best in well-drained soil.</p>

                        <p><strong>Problems:</strong> Mostly trouble free with the possibility of minor leaf spot. Callicarpa can get rangy over time &ndash; rejuvenate by pruning low to the ground in late winter (like you do your roses). Flowers are produced on new growth, so you won't miss out on winter berries.</p>
