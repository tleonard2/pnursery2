                <h2>In this day and age we&rsquo;ve come to expect a lot from our plants.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve got to have great flowers, they&rsquo;ve got to have good clean foliage, fall color of course, and they really should take care of themselves.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want to have to baby them.</h2>

                <p>Itea, Sweetspire, is one of those plants that have all of the above and more.&nbsp; It grows in sun or shade, the flowers smell great and it is well behaved.&nbsp; It does not bully and is not promiscuous.</p>

                <h2><em>Itea</em> &lsquo;Little Henry&rsquo;</h2>

                <p>White flowers in shorter 3-4&rdquo; spikes with light sweet scent in June &amp; July. Fall foliage is red to purple. Grows to 3&rsquo; x 3&rsquo; with dense compact habit.&nbsp;</p>
                <hr>

                <h2><em>Itea illicifolia</em> 'Holly Sweetspire'</h2>

                <p>Native to Western China. This is an excellent form of Itea. Small light green to white flowers are borne on 6-12&rdquo; long racemes that remind me of a many-chrystalled drapey chandelier. Flowers bloom in July &amp; August. Dark glossy leaves are spiny like holly but not quite as sharp. It is reliably evergreen.</p>

                <p>Grows to be 6-12&rsquo; tall &amp; wide. Prefers a sunny to partly sunny spot with well-drained moist soil that is protected from desiccating winds during winter. Hardy in Zone 8-9 (should be okay in Portland if protected from icy east winds).</p>
