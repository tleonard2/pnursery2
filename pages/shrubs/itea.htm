			<h2>ITEA: Sweetspire </h2>

			<p>In this day and  age we&rsquo;ve come to expect a lot from our plants.&nbsp;  They&rsquo;ve got to have great flowers, they&rsquo;ve got to have good clean  foliage, fall color of course, and they really should take care of themselves.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want to have to baby them.&nbsp; <br />
Itea,  Sweetspire, is one of those plants that have all of the above and more.&nbsp; It grows in sun or shade, the flowers smell  great and it is well behaved.&nbsp; It does  not bully and is not promiscuous.</p>

  <p><img src="../images/itea_sweetspire/i-virginica-HenrysGarnet235.jpg" alt="Henry's Garnet" width="235" height="235" border="0" class="left" /><em><strong>Itea virginica</strong></em> is native to the southeastern US, growing  along stream banks in moist soil.&nbsp;Cultivated varieties are plentiful so we&rsquo;ve selected our favorites for  discussion. </p>
   <p class="clear"></p>

  <p><strong>&lsquo;Henry&rsquo;s Garnet&rsquo;</strong> &ndash;  White flowers along 6&rdquo; spikes are lightly fragrant, blooming in June and  July.Deciduous leaves are green with  coppery new growth and amazing bright red in fall. Leaves stay on the plant into December.Compact growth, matures at 3-4&rsquo; tall and 4-6&rsquo;  wide. It can grow larger given  time.&nbsp;  </p>

  <p><img src="../images/itea_sweetspire/itea-litteHenry2-235.jpg" alt="Little Henry" width="235" height="233" border="0" class="left" /><strong>&lsquo;Little Henry&rsquo;</strong> &ndash;  White flowers in <strong class="clear"></strong>shorter 3-4&rdquo; spikes with light sweet scent in June &amp; July. Fall foliage is red to purple. Grows to 3&rsquo; x 3&rsquo; with dense compact habit.&nbsp; </p>
   <p class="clear"></p>

  <p><strong>&lsquo;Merlot&rsquo;</strong> &ndash;  Flowers are the same as &lsquo;Little Henry&rsquo;.  Leaves are all green in summer with darker red and purple color in  fall. Grows to 3-4&rsquo; tall. </p>

  <p><img src="../images/itea_sweetspire/itea3-illiciifolia235.jpg" alt="Itea illicifolia" width="235" height="313" border="0" class="left" /><em><strong>Itea illicifolia</strong></em> Holly Sweetspire &ndash; <em><strong></strong></em>Native to Western China<br />
             This is an  excellent form of Itea. Small light  green to white flowers are borne on 6-12&rdquo; long racemes that remind me of a  many-chrystalled drapey chandelier. Flowers  bloom in July &amp; August. Dark glossy  leaves are spiny like holly but not quite as sharp. It is reliably evergreen.</p>
             <p>Grows to be 6-12&rsquo; tall &amp; wide. Prefers a sunny to partly sunny spot with  well-drained moist soil that is protected from desiccating winds during  winter. Hardy in Zone 8-9 (should be  okay in Portland  if protected from icy east winds).</p>
