   <h2>HEATHERS AND HEATHS </h2>

			<p>No other plants offer the colorful, ever changing year round display of Heaths and Heathers. At least one variety is in bloom every day of the year. Heathers cheer the sometimes-tired late summer garden with their abundant flowers of pink, purple, or white, then lend accent to the winter blooming Heaths with their bright evergreen foliage of chartreuse bronze or red. </p>
	  <p>And as for the Heaths themselves, they bloom right through even our hardest winters, providing a touch or bright color to an otherwise gray landscape. There are no wrong combinations with Heaths and Heathers; their beauty in masses has given us the phrase &quot;heather tones&quot; for multi-colored things which blend together well. </p>
	  <h3>CALLUNA<br />
	    Heather, Scotch Heather, Ling</h3>
      <p><strong><img src="../images/ericacaea/calluna-vulgaris200.jpg" alt="Calluna vulgaris" width="200" height="282" class="left" />Calluna</strong> comes from the Greek word kallunein, meaning  to cleanse, probably because the twigs were used to make brooms.
        Callunas have just a single species, <em>C. vulgaris</em>, but over 800 cultivated forms are in  existence.</p>
      <p><strong>Flowers:</strong> Tiny bell shape flowers during summer in colors ranging from  white to crimson. Bud-bloomers are flowers that never mature beyond the bud  stage and because of this, maintain their color for a long period. Double  flower forms have more petals, so they look like pearl-size balls along the  branches.</p>
      <p><strong>Foliage: </strong>Evergreen leaves are feathery or sometimes  scale-like. Leaf color can be silver, green, gold or variegated, and many  Callunas change color in the winter, turning brilliant orange, red or  chocolate. Several varieties have red, coral or white new growth in spring.<strong></strong></p>
      <p>Some varieties you can find at Portland Nursery include:</p>

      <p class="clear"><strong><em>Calluna vulgaris</em> 'Robert Chapman'</strong></p>
	  <p>'Robert Chapman' &ndash; yellow-orange foliage becomes more intense in winter, mauve flowers Aug.</p>
	  <hr />
			<p>Calluna vulgaris: 'Allegro' &ndash; red flowers on green foliage July &ndash; Oct.<br />
			  'Firefly' &ndash; yellow-orange foliage turns bright red in         winter, mauve flowers late summer<br />
			  'Kerstin' &ndash; grayish foliage turns lilac in winter, mauve flowers Aug. &ndash; Sept.<br />
			  'Silver Knight' &ndash; the most silver foliage of any Heather, lavender flowers July &ndash; Sept.<br />
			  'Spring Torch' &ndash; dark green foliage with yellow, pink, and red new growth, mauve flowers Aug. &ndash; Oct.<br />
	  'Winter Chocolate' &ndash; gold foliage turns chocolate bronze in winter, pink new growth, lavender flowers summer.</p>

<h3>DABOECIA - Irish Heath </h3>
           <p><img src="../images/ericacaea/daboecia-scotia-william-buchanan200.jpg" alt="Daboecia scotia 'William Buchanan'" width="200" height="269" class="left" />Daboecia is named for the Irish Saint Dabeoc  (Linneus transposed the <em>o</em> and <em>e</em> when formulating our present Latin  system of naming plants and the misspelled version stuck).</p>
<p><strong><em>D. azorica</em></strong> and <strong><em>D.  cantabrica</em></strong> (shown below) exist in nature and <strong><em>D. x scotica</em> </strong>is a man-made hybrid of the two  naturally occurring forms.</p>
           <p><strong>Flowers:</strong> Bell  flowers are the largest of all the Heathers to &frac12;&rdquo; long and can be white, pink,  red, magenta or purple. &nbsp;Flowers are held  in racemes above the foliage &amp; bloom from June to October.</p>
      <p><strong>Foliage: </strong>Evergreen leaves are dark green and glossy  and resemble a simple leaf more than Callunas or Ericas.</p>

   <h3>ERICA - Heath </h3>
     <p><strong>Erica</strong> is from the Greek work <em>ereiko</em> meaning &lsquo;to break&rsquo;. Possibly  because the stems break easily and possibly because of the medieval belief that  it could be used medicinally to dissolve gall stones.</p>
     <p><strong><img src="../images/ericacaea/erica-darleyensis200.jpg" alt="Erica darleyensis" width="200" height="293" class="left" />Flowers:</strong> Small bell-shape flowers can be white, pink, mauve, cerise,  magenta or purple. Bloom-time varies per species. </p>
     <p><strong>Winter/Spring  flowers:</strong> <em>E. carnea, E. darleyensis</em> (shown at left) </p>
     <p><strong>Summer/Fall  flowers:</strong> <em>E. cinerea </em>(shown below)<em>, E. griffithsii, E. stuartii, E.  tetralix &amp; E. vegans</em></p>
     <p><strong>Foliage:</strong> Evergreen leaves look like tiny needles and can be green,  gold or blue.</p>

   <h3>FACTS: HEATHERS    </h3>
   <p><strong>Family: </strong>Ericaceae</p>
       <p><strong>Genus: </strong>Calluna CAL-EW-NA</p>
       <p><strong>Origin: </strong><em>Callunas </em>span the whole of Europe,  from the western coast to the Ural Mountains,  expanding to North Africa &amp; the southern  fringe of the Arctic Circle. They&rsquo;ve  naturalized in eastern Canada  from seed contained in packaging from early settlers.</p>
       <p><strong>Size:</strong> Varies from ground-hugging 2&rdquo;x18&rdquo; to upright 24&rdquo;x30&rdquo;</p>
       <p><strong>Culture: </strong>Sun, acidic, well-drained moist soil. Soils  west of the cascades are acidic due to copious rain, but often drainage is a  problem, so adding compost when planting helps. Callunas are tolerant to  drought once established. </p>
       <p><strong>Hardiness:</strong> USDA Zone 5</p>
       <p><strong>Problems:</strong> Very few. Over watering and dense heavy  soils can cause plants to rot or lose foliage in the center. Bugs and diseases  are rare in Portland.</p>
       <p class="caption">* * * * * </p>
       <p><strong>Family: </strong>Ericaceae</p>
       <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Daboecia, DAB-OH-SHE-A</p>
       <p><strong>Origin: </strong><em>Daboecia</em> is found in coastal areas of Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal and  the Azore Islands off of the coast of Portugal.</p>
       <p><strong>Size: </strong>Vary from 8&rdquo;x20&rdquo; to 16&rdquo;x28&rdquo;</p>
       <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Sun, part shade, acidic soil, tolerant of drought once  established, but prefer even moisture. Trim annually after bloom to keep  foliage full.</p>
       <p><strong>Hardiness:</strong> USDA Zone 6</p>
       <p><strong>Problems:</strong> Can look straggly if not pruned annually  after bloom.</p>
       <p class="caption">* * * * *</p>
       <p><strong>Family: </strong>Ericaceae</p>
       <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Erica  ERR-I-CA<br />
         <br />
         <strong>Origin: </strong><em>Ericas</em> encompass over 800 species originating  from South Africa,  Europe &amp; Turkey.</p>
       <p><strong>Size:</strong> Most <em>Ericas</em> are  low-growing shrubs ranging between 12&rdquo; &amp; 24&rdquo; tall. Tree heathers (<em>E.</em> <em>arborea  &amp; E. australis</em>) are upright-growing varieties that can reach 20&rsquo; in  their native habitats. In Portland  we see 4-5&rsquo; easily, perhaps taller if planted in an area that is not too windy.</p>
       <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Ericas are happiest in sunny spots with well-drained, moist  acidic soil. Several species will adapt to dryness, alkaline soil and partial  shade. Prune annually to keep heathers looking full.</p>
       <p><strong>Hardiness: </strong>Varies per species from USDA Zone 4-9</p>
       <p><strong>Problems:</strong> Ericas suffer from heavy soils and can  die out in the center or lose portions from root-rot. Amend with compost to  help create good soil drainage when planting. Pests and diseases are typically  not seen in Portland.</p>
