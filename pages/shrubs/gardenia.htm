	        <h2>HARDY GARDENIA </h2>

			<p>In Portland,  full sun is best for Hardy Gardenias. In climates with very hot summers, light shade is preferred. </p>
	        <p>The best time to plant Gardenias is in spring so they have  plenty of time to produce roots before being challenged with winter cold. Gardenias  prefer to grow in acidic soils. Use fertilizers and soil amendments that do not  contain lime that will &lsquo;sweeten&rsquo; soil, or raise the pH. </p>
	        <p>If growing a Gardenia  in a container, add trace minerals including iron. Gardenias dislike root  disturbance, so add mulch to root areas rather than cultivating soil around  roots.<br />
	          Night  temperatures between 50-55 degrees are necessary to form flower buds.</p>
	        <p>Cold hardy forms  are <strong>&lsquo;Kleim&rsquo;s Hardy&rsquo;, &lsquo;Frost Proof&rsquo;,</strong> and <strong>&lsquo;Chuck Hayes&rsquo;. </strong>They are hardy to USDA zone 7(0-10f) and should survive cold Portland winters. These varieties may still  struggle with the amount of moisture many of our heavy soils hold during  winter, so adding pumice and organic matter to the soil when planting to  provide exceptional soil drainage is a very good idea. They are excellent  plants for growing in containers as well.</p>
	        <p>Traditional  tropical Gardenias enjoy living outdoors during summer and coming inside during  winter, or living as houseplants year-round. They are  hardy in  zone 9.</p>
	        <p>Here are some of our favorites. </p>

   <h3>FACTS: HARDY GARDENIA </h3>
       <p><strong>Family: </strong>Rubiaceae &ndash; also the family of Coffee Plant (Coffea arabica), Mirror Plant (Coprosma),  and Quinine (Cinchona pubescens)</p>
       <p><strong>Genus: </strong>Gardenia</p>
       <p><strong>Common: </strong>Gardenia or Cape Jasmine</p>
       <p><strong>Origin: </strong>China </p>
       <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> White waxy flowers have a strong and  distinctive fragrance. Leaves are dark green and glossy.</p>
       <p><strong>Size:</strong> Size varies per variety and ranges between 12&rdquo; tall and 5&rsquo;  tall.</p>
       <p><strong>Hardiness:</strong> Until very recently Gardenias were  tropical shrubs, hardy in climates with winters warmer and drier than ours. Many  varieties are still in that group, but several new forms have been released in  the past few years that are more cold tolerant.</p>
       <p><strong>Diseases:</strong> Gardenias are susceptible to several  pests and diseases. Whitefly, aphids and scale are common insects that can  affect Gardenias. When any of them are present they may be accompanied by black  sooty mildew along stems and leaves. </p>
       <p>Root rot can also occur. <br />
         Another common problem is  &quot;bud drop.&quot; Flower buds form, look like they are going to open, but  turn yellow and drop off instead. Common causes include overwatering,  underwatering, insufficient light and high temperatures and low humidity.</p>
