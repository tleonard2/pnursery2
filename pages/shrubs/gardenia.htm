<h2>The heady scent of Gardenia flowers wafting through thick summer air is nothing short of scrumptious! For what seemed like eons, Portland gardeners were relagated to growing Gardenias that would die if left outdoors in winter, but in the last 10 years, several hardy types have emerged, and they're pretty darn good plants. Aren't we lucky to live in the era of Hardy Gardenias?</h2>
<p>To be successful follow a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant in spring so Gardenias have a chance to set strong roots before winter.</li>
<li>Gardenias are big eaters! They need to be fertilized to produce abundant flowers. Use fertilizers and soil amendments for acid-loving plants (Rhododendron food) and make sure not to add lime - this raises soil pH.</li>
<li>Night temperatures between 50-55f are necessary to form flower buds, so be patient - it'll happen eventually.</li>
<li>Gardenias dislike root disturbance, so don't plant labor intensive plants around the base. Do add mulch to the root zone, making sure not to pile it around the base of the shrub.</li>
<li>You may be surprised, but Gardenias like a bit of a break from the heat of the day! Plant them in a spot with afternoon shade.</li>
<li>Gardenias are not drought tolerant. They need deep, weekly watering during dry seasons and more frequent watering during heat waves.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are new varieties coming out every year, but we consistantly carry the following varieties:</p>

<h2>Facts: Hardy Gardenia</h2>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Rubiaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Gardenia</p>
<p><strong>Common:</strong> Gardenia or Cape Jasmine</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> China</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> White waxy flowers have a strong and distinctive fragrance. Leaves are dark green and glossy. Grows well in acidic soil, which (lucky us) is what we have here in Portland.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Size varies per variety and ranges between 12&rdquo; tall and 5&rsquo; tall.</p>
<p><strong>Hardiness:</strong> Until very recently Gardenias were tropical shrubs, hardy in climates with winters warmer and drier than ours. Many varieties are still in that group, but several new forms have been released in the past few years that are more cold tolerant.</p>
<p><strong>Problems:</strong> Gardenias are susceptible to several pests and diseases. Whitefly, aphids and scale are common insects that can affect Gardenias. When any of them are present they may be accompanied by black sooty mildew along stems and leaves. These are far more likely to be a problem for plants that spend all or part of their lives indoors.</p>
<p>Bud Drop - Flower buds form, look like they are going to open, but turn yellow and drop off instead. Common causes include overwatering, underwatering, insufficient light, high temperatures and low humidity. Again, this is far more common when Gardenias are grown as houseplants.</p>
