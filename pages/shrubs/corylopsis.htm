<h2>Winterhazel is one of the shining stars of the winter garden. Bare branches zig and zag creating a unique pattern, with yellow buds at branch tips. In February scented butter yellow flowers open and hang in clusters like cute little lanterns.</h2>
<p>During the rest of the year, <em>Corylopsis&nbsp;</em>is a trouble-free member of the garden. Blue-green heart-shape leaves cloak stems as flowers drop. Fall color is gold. They grow well in sun or shade and are suited to modern, woodland or border gardens.</p>
<p>Several species of&nbsp;Winter Hazels exist and we try to stock a few varieties every year, with guest stars available from time to time.</p>
<h2><em>Corylopsis glabrescens:</em> Fragrant Winterhazel</h2>
<p>Pale yellow fragrant flowers in clusters 1-1/2&rdquo; long. We sometimes get the Corylopsis glabrescents variety 'Longwood Chimes', which was selected for longer flower clusters and intense fragrance. Taller growing Winterhazels can be treated as small trees in the garden and look similar to the Northwest native Vine Maple <em>Acer circinatum</em>.</p>
<p>Grows 8-15&rsquo; tall and wide. Zone 5</p>

<h2><em>Corylopsis pauciflora</em>: Buttercup Winterhazel</h2>
<p>Dainty flower clusters and leaves are smaller than other species. Slender twiggy branches spread out and fill in all the way to the ground. Over time Corylopsis pauciflora develops a flat-topped fountain shape.</p>
<p>Grows 4-6' x 6-8', Zone 6</p>
<hr /><br /><hr />
<h2><em>Corylopsis sinensis: </em>Chinese Winterhazel<em><br /></em></h2>
<p>Light yellow flowers 2&rdquo; long, followed by large leaves that are dark green on top and chalky blue-green beneath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grows 8-10&rsquo; tall and wide.&nbsp; Zone 5 <em>syn.</em> <em>Corylopsis willmottiae</em></p>

<h2><em>Corylopsis spicata</em>: Spike Winterhazel</h2>
<p>Fragrant yellow flowers with dark red-brown anthers, in short clusters 1-2&rsquo; long. New leaves are covered in fuzz. Zig-zagging branches form a unique and intricate pattern.</p>
<p>Grows 6-10' x 6-10', Zone 5. </p>

<h2>Facts: Corylopsis</h2>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Hamamelidaceae</p>
<p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Winterhazel</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Bhutan, China, Japan</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong>&nbsp;Hanging clusters of funnel-shaped butter-yellow flowers in February-March attract hummingbirds. Heart-shape leaves with serrated edges follow and turn gold in autumn before falling off to reveal a lacy network of zig-zag branches.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp;Varies per species - they range between 4' and 12'</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong>&nbsp;Once rooted into the ground Corylopsis is fairly self-sufficient, and weekly deep watering during dry spells in the first year will help it to get well established. They're happiest when protected from hot afternoon sun, but allowed morning sun or dappled shade. Deep dark holes are not a place where Corylopsis will thrive. If planted in full sun, extra watering will be required.</p>
<p>Add mulch once a year. Be careful to apply it to the root zone only and don't pile it up&nbsp;on the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>Problems:</strong>&nbsp;Winter Hazels are usually pest and disease-free. Leaves can burn in hot afternoon sun, and they're large shrubs&nbsp;so if enough space is not allotted, pruning will be a regular part of care.</p>
