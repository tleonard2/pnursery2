                <h2>The foliage of Edgeworthia is attractive, but this is a plant grown for its flowers. The flowers appear on the branch tips like little suns. Individual flowers are tubular bright yellow aging to creamy white, densely packed in globosely shaped heads.</h2>

                <p>The flowers are fragrant and open late winter around February in the NW from buds that have been obvious from the previous year. Edgeworthia is not difficult to grow and it is a joy waiting for their moment of glory when flowering. They definitely possess that 'weird' appeal that collectors love. In China it is used to make paper and medicine.</p>
