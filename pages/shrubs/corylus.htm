<h2>Corylus: Filberts and Hazelnuts</h2>
<p>There are so many Hazelnut farms in the Willamette Valley that it is difficult to avoid them when traveling through it's rolling hills and winding highways. Hazelnuts are an important crop for farmers in the Northwest, and it is a great place to grow them; indeed the Northwest native form of Corylus is rampant in the Portand area and all through the valley. There are several garden-worthy ornamental Hazelnuts hailing from Turkey and Europe as well.</p>

<h2><em>Corylus avellana</em> 'Contorta'</h2>
<p><strong>Contorted Filbert, Harry Lauder's Walking Stick</strong></p>
<p>These are some of our favorite plants for winter interest because the branches twist and turn in such a beautiful way. They carry catkins through winter that elongate when weather warms and yellow flowers bloom. Leaves are dull green, so not much to look at during summer.</p>

<h2><em>Corylus avellana</em> 'Red Dragon'</h2>
<p>Finally a contorted Filbert that is resistant to Filbert Blight! 'Red Dragon' boasts wonderful curling gray branches, dangling pink catkins in early spring and dark purple leaves with a matte surface. Developed at OSU.</p>

<h2><em>Corylus colurna &ndash;</em> Turkish Hazel</h2>
<p>The Turkish Hazel is an easy to grow shade tree with decorative yellow catkins in late winter and nuts in summer. An excellent choice for wildlife habitat, it provides cover and food for birds and squirrels. It's resistant to Eastern Filbert Blight and adjusts to various soil conditions smoothly.<br /> Grows 35-50' in a pyramid shape &ndash; Sun-part shade, Z4</p>

<h2>Filberts for Nut Production</h2>
<figure><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/corylus/corylus-avellananuts750.jpg" alt="Corylus avellana&lt;/em&gt; &ndash; European Hazelnut, Filbert " /></figure>
<h2><em>Corylus avellana</em> &ndash; European Hazelnut, Filbert</h2>
<p>Oregon is the largest producer of Hazelnuts in the US with most orchards located in the Willamette Valley, and for years the industry has been plagued by Eastern Filbert Blight, an insidious fungal disease. To help one of our major food industries, Oregon State University developed a series of blight resistant varieties, which are now available to retail nurseries like us!</p>
<p><strong>Pollination:</strong> Hazelnut pollination is tricky and it's important to plant the right combination of trees in order to have good nut production. Coordinating pollen shed with bloom is one factor. Hazelnuts have male and female flowers; male flowers produce pollen and female flowers make nuts, and male flowers produce pollen for a longer period of time than female flowers are open. Additionally some Hazelnuts are genetically incompatible. So...complicated! But we try to make it more simple here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant a minimum of 3 varieties to cover pollen timing</li>
<li>We only sell disease resistant varieties of Filberts</li>
<li>Felix &amp; Theta are not genetically compatible</li>
</ul>
<p>We carry 3-4 of the following varieties each spring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eta &ndash; Late - pollinates Epsilon, Felix, Jefferson &amp; Theta</li>
<li>Epsilon - Late - pollinates Eta, Felix, Jefferson &amp; Theta</li>
<li>Felix - Mid-Late - pollinates Eta, Epsilon, Jefferson &amp; Yamhill</li>
<li>Jefferson &ndash; Mid - pollinates Eta, Felix, Theta, Yamhill </li>
<li>Theta &ndash; Late - pollinates Epsilon, Eta, Jefferson and Yamhill</li>
<li>Yamhill &ndash; Mid - pollinates Felix, Jefferson and Theta</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Harvest:</strong> Trees will begin producing nuts in about 2-3 years. Nuts ripen in autumn and are ready for harvesting when the husk can be removed easily. You may either hand pick or lay a cloth under the tree and tap the limbs to make the nuts drop. Nets may be used to keep the squirrels away.</p>

<p>Trees can grow up to 20' but can be kept at 10-12' x 10-12' and should be planted no more than 15' apart for good pollination.<br /> Sun-part shade, Z4</p>

<h2>Facts: Filberts &amp; Hazels</h2>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Betulaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Corylus (CORE-ill-us)</p>
<p><strong>Common:</strong> Harry Lauder's Walking Stick, Filbert, Hazelnut</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to US, Europe, Turkey, China</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>15 species of deciduous shrubs &amp; trees</li>
<li>Male &amp; female flowers are on the same plant.</li>
<li>Male flowers occur in catkins that bloom in winter, yellow or pink.</li>
<li>Female flowers are on lateral buds w/ prominent red stigmas</li>
<li>Nuts set in clusters, each nut surrounded by involucre (modified leaves/bracts).</li>
<li>Plant 2 different varieties that bloom in tandem if growing for nut production</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Varies depending on species.<br /> Shrubby types grow to around 8-12'<br /> Tree froms vary from 15' to 50'</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Plant in sun-part shade</p>
<p><strong>Problems:</strong> Eastern Filbert Blight has long plagued Oregon's Hazelnut orchards, but recently varieties have been developed that have strong resistance to the disease. Portland Nursery is fortunate to offer only blight resistant Filberts used for nut production in 2012.</p>
<p><em>Corylus cornuta v. californica</em> Western Hazelnut (our native Filbert) &amp; <em>Corylus colurna</em> Turkish Hazel are resistant to Filbert Blight<a href="http://plant-disease.ippc.orst.edu/ShowDisease.aspx?RecordID=578" target="_blank">. Read more about Filbert Blight</a></p>
<p>Filberts are susceptible to a number of additional disease problems. Most occur in the orchard setting (a lot of the same kind of plant grown in one place). Powdery Mildew is the most common problem in garden settings. <a href="http://plant-disease.ippc.orst.edu/hostsee.aspx?host_see=Hazelnut" target="_blank">Read more about Hazelnut diseases</a></p>
