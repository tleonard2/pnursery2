   <h2>HARDY PALMS </h2>

			<p>In Portland there are a number of palm trees  that are hardy enough to survive and thrive. They offer a very tropical look to  the garden as well as intense texture year round. Hardy palms are absolutely a  necessity for a tropical garden offering a perfect focal point.</p>
         <p>Palm trees appreciate a  sunny location with well-drained soil. Since  in the northwest we get a lot of rainfall and many of our soils have a heavy  clay component, the soil preparation is a very important step in planting hardy  palms. </p>
         <ul>
	  		  <li>Remove some of the clay (1/4 &ndash; 1/3) in the planting  area.</li>
	  		  <li>Dig a hole about as deep as the container and twice  as wide. A wider hole is okay.</li>
	  		  <li>Mix pumice or grit, sand and organic matter (such as  compost) with the existing soil.&nbsp; </li>
	  		  <li>Use the blended soil to plant. Keep the soil level the same as it was in the  container. Do not pile soil around the  base of the trunk.</li>
	  		  <li>Palms also do great in containers, you can use a well  drained potting soil or create you own mix with the soil ingredients listed  above for ground planting.</li>
   </ul>

  <p><strong><em><img src="../images/hardy-palms/butia-capitata200.jpg" alt="Butia capitata" class="left" width="200" height="306" />Butia capitata</em></strong> -
   Pindo Palm, Jelly Palm<br />
   The best known palm of its  species, they truly deserve to be better known. Butia is one of the coldest  hardy and beautiful feather palms. Mature plants have a very stout trunk and a  thick crown. The fronds gracefully curve downwards towards the stout base (very  dramatic). This species can tolerate clay soil. It is best to improve heavy  soil with pumice or grit and plenty of organic matter. <br />
   Hardy to 15 F. Native to Brazil. </p>

   Mediterranean Fan Palm. <br />
   Multi trunk palm that grows  to about 15&rsquo; tall, very shrubby. Fronds shaped like open fans with spines on  the stems. Tolerates poor soil and strong winds. Hardy to 0 F. Native to the West Mediterranean region. </p>

     Blue Form Mediterranean Fan  Palm<br />
     Same as species except it  has silvery powder blue fronds. Great specimen. </p>
   <p class="clear"></p>

  <p><strong><em>Sabal palmetto</em></strong> - Palmetto<br />
     Large palm with a rough  trunk. Fronds to 6&rsquo; long. This palm can reach up to 20&rsquo; tall and 10&rsquo; wide.
     Hardy to 10-20 F.&nbsp; Found in N. Carolina to Florida. (Shown in side panel)  </p>

  <p><strong><em><img src="../images/hardy-palms/t-fortunei2-200.jpg" alt="Trachycarpus fortunei" class="left" width="200" height="291" />Trachycarpus fortunei</em></strong> -
	    Windmill Palm<br />
	    Single trunk with very  attractive habit. Probably one if the most popular and reliable palms grown in  the Pacific NW. </p>
	    <p>It can tolerate growing in  restricted areas such as a courtyard. Leaves grow to 18-30&rdquo; long and are fan  shaped. Mature local specimens are up to  15-18&rsquo; tall.
	      Hardy to 10 F. Native to  temperate and mountain forest in subtropical Asia.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Trachycarpus wagnerianus</em></strong> -
	    Dwarf Chusian Palms<br />
	    Similar to Windmill Palm,  but this unique palm has very stiff short fronds and a more compact appearance.  It does very well in containers and is just plain cute. The stiffer stouter  foliage withstands windy conditions better without tips sagging.</p>
	    <p>Hardy to 10F.&nbsp; Unknown in the wild; thought to originate in Japan. (See	side panel)  </p>

	  Mexican Fan Palm<br />
	  Semi- hardy palm that will  grow tall faster than other species.</p>
	  <p>Only  hardy to 20 F. The Slender trunk tapers down to a nice coppery brown base.  Leaves sharply toothed. Bright green fronds to 3&rsquo; long. Great for coastal  gardens.<br />

   <h3>FACTS: HARDY PALMS </h3>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Arecaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genera: </strong><em>Rhapidophyllum, Sabal, and Trachycarpus</em></p>
<p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Hardy Palm </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Any of the species of palm (Arecaceae) that are able to withstand colder temperatures and thrive  in places not typically considered in the natural range for palms.  Several are native to higher elevations in Asia and can tolerate hard freezes with little or no damage. Many of these  species can be cultivated at high latitudes, and in places that  regularly see snow in winter.</p>
<p><strong>Culture: </strong>In winter colder areas with  high wind conditions some protection is needed. You don&rsquo;t want you nice fronds  to get frost bitten. You can wrap the leaves with burlap or a frost blanket.  The fronds tie up very easy and the palm is not very hard to cover.</p>
<p>In summer, watering is very  easy. In the wild you will typically find palms growing near water, if you are  thinking about planting a palm tree make sure that your palm will receive an  adequate amount of water and be prepared to water frequently when transplanting  a new tree. Since they are in a well drained soil the roots shouldn&rsquo;t mind the  extra water. (Note: They are not water plants so no boggy areas, remember well  drained soil.)</p>
