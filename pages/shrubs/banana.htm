<p>Wouldn't you like to visit the tropics? Why not bring the tropics to you? With their giant leaves and palm-like structure, banana plants are a key element to adding a tropical feel to your garden.</p>
<p>All bananas are tropical in origin, but some are hardy enough to grow in the ground where summers are hot, and winters don't dip below zero. We refer to these as Hardy Bananas. Bananas that are more tender to cold are refered to as "tropical". Both can be grown successfully in Portland, they just require different care during the winter. Both types of bananas grow fast, produce big leaves and if summers are long and hot enough, we may see flowers as well. Sadly none of the bananas can produce edible fruit in Portland; our hot season is just not long enough.</p>

<h2>Hardy Bananas</h2>

<h2><em>Musa basjoo:</em> Japanese Fiber Banana</h2>
<p>What a nice specimen for a tropical look in the garden! Musa basjoo can grow <em>10&rsquo; tall in one season</em> from ground level and if trunks are well insulated in winter they can reach 15&rsquo; tall. Huge green leaves can reach to 6&rsquo; long! Flowers are yellow and if conditions are right, small seedy fruits may develop.</p>
<p>In late fall cut trunks down to 2' and lay the leaves around the base of the trunk. Add straw or another mulch that doesn&rsquo;t hold excessive moisture to prevent trunk rot. Each spring, pips (new baby bananas) appear at the base of the main trunk and in no time your single plant can easily become a grove.</p>
<p>To support a strong single trunk, wrap the trunk with an insulating fabric like frost blanket or burlap and add mulch to the root zone. Remove protective fabric in spring when new growth appears.</p>

<h2><em>Musella lasiocarpa:</em>&nbsp;Golden Lotus Banana</h2>
<p>Musella lasiocarpa is a shrubby banana with large&nbsp;blue-green leaves and exotic gold flowers that often bloom after the second year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its smaller size, 4-5' tall and about as wide, makes it easier to add to a sunny garden than the tree-like Japanese Banana.</p>
<p>Full sun to part shade, moist well drained fertile soil, Zone 7, 0-10f</p>

<h2>Tropical Bananas</h2>

<h2><em>Ensete ventricosum</em> 'Maurelli': Abyssinian or Red-leaf Banana</h2>
<p>There is a classic, tropical appearance to this fast growing palm-like ornamental banana. Rising from the single trunk, the leaves are very large; 6-8&rsquo; long and paddle shaped, bright green with red accents and vibrant red midrib. Very striking, indeed!</p>
<p>Plant in full sun and protect from strong winds that can tatter its big leaves.</p>
<p>Hardy Z9, 20-30f - This banana is not hardy in Portland, so special measures should be taken to keep it alive through cold winter months. Check the&nbsp;<em>Overwintering Tropical Bananas</em> portion of our article for options.</p>

<h2>Facts: Banana</h2>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Musaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Musa</p>
<p><strong>Common:</strong> Banana</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Tropical region of Southeast Asia</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Bananas are cultivated primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent for the production of fibre and as ornamental plants. As the banana plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy they are often mistaken for trees, but their main or upright stem is actually a <em>pseudostem</em> (literally "fake stem").</p>
<p>For some species this pseudostem can reach a height of up to 2&ndash;8&nbsp;m, with leaves of up to 3.5;m in length. Each pseudostem can produce a bunch of green bananas which when ripened often turn yellow or sometimes red.</p>
<p>A variety was even recently discovered in a rainforest in Asia that turns purple. This then dies and is replaced by another pseudostem.</p>
<p><strong>Foliage:</strong> Treated strictly as ornamentals, these types of bananas are grown for their foliage, not for fruit. Bananas can grow to 15 feet tall and can be quite dramatic with their large leaves. Use bananas in large containers or as specimen plants in landscape beds.</p>
