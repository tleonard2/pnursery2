   <h2>BANANA</h2>

			<p>Bananas are truly one of the  most tropical looking plants. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to go to the tropics? Why not bring the tropics to you?</p>
   <p>A lot of people like to have that tropical look  in their gardens, whether it&rsquo;s in a container or in the ground. There are two  hardy species that you can grow in our colder climate: one is <em>Musa basjoo</em>, and the other is <em>Musella  lasiocarpa</em>. </p>
   <p>Both do great in containers or in the ground and are hardy to  Zone 6. Winter protection should be given to them if you want them to grow  really large the following year. To do this, most people just cut them back to  about 2&rsquo; tall and mulch them with good-draining compost. </p>
   <p>Others will securely  wrap the trunks with a insulator such as a frost blanket and plastic to keep  the trunk from freezing. If you choose to insulate the trunk then you banana  will have a head start the next year.</p>
   <p>With tropical bananas, you  will either need to winter them over indoors as a house plant or you can put  them in a frost proof place such as a garage or basement and allow them do go  semi dormant until the chance of last frost is gone and then return them to the  outdoors.</p>
   <h3>Hardy Bananas </h3>

    <div class="genuscontainerwide"><p><strong><em><img src="../images/banana/musa_basjoo200.jpg" alt="Musa basjoo" width="200" height="262" />Musa basjoo -</em></strong> Japanese fiber banana<br />
       What a nice specimen for a  tropical look in the garden! &nbsp;Very hardy  to -20 degrees, &nbsp;this banana can grow <em>10&rsquo; tall in one season</em> from ground level!  &nbsp;If the trunks are well insulated in  winter they can reach 15&rsquo; tall. </p>
       <p>Leaves can reach to 6&rsquo; lengths.&nbsp; Otherwise cut the stalks down to about 2&rsquo; in  late fall and mulch with leaves, straw or something that doesn&rsquo;t hold to much  moisture to prevent trunk rot. Each new year the will send up pips (new baby  bananas) and your plant can easily become a grove. It should be planted in full  to partial sun with moist, well drained soil. To increase fast growth, be  generous with nitrogen. Use as recommended on manufactures label.</p>

       </em></strong>Abyssinian Banana<strong></strong><br />
There is a classic, tropical  appearance to this fast growing palm-like ornamental Banana. Rising from the single  trunk, the leaves are very large; 6-8&rsquo; long and paddle shaped, bright green with  a vibrant red lower midrib. Very striking, indeed!&nbsp; </p>
         <p class="clear">Plant in full to partial sun and be sure to protect  it from strong winds. Not winter hardy in the Pacific Northwest, so must be  overwintered indoors.</p>

   <h3>FACTS: BANANA </h3>
<p><strong>Family: </strong>Musaceae</p>
   <p><strong>Genus: </strong>Musa</p>
   <p><strong>Common: </strong>Banana</p>
   <p><strong>Origin: </strong>Tropical region of Southeast Asia </p>
   <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Bananas  are cultivated primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent for the production of fibre and as ornamental plants. As the banana plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy they are often mistaken for trees, but their main or upright stem is actually a <em>pseudostem</em> (literally &quot;fake stem&quot;). </p>
   <p>For some species this pseudostem can reach a height of up to 2&ndash;8&nbsp;m, with leaves of up to 3.5&nbsp;m in length.  Each pseudostem can produce a bunch of green bananas which when ripened  often turn yellow or sometimes red. </p>
   <p>A variety was even recently  discovered in a rainforest in Asia that turns purple. This then dies  and is replaced by another pseudostem.</p>
   <p><strong>Foliage: </strong>Treated strictly as ornamentals, these types of bananas are grown for  their foliage, not for fruit. Bananas can grow to 15 feet tall and can  be quite dramatic with their large leaves. Use bananas in large  containers or as specimen plants in landscape beds.</p>
