                <h2>Elderberries for Fruit</h2>

                <figure><img src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/sambucus/Sambucus-canadensis750.jpg" alt="Sambucus canadensis"></figure>

                <h2><em>Sambucus canadensis</em>: American Elder or Elderberry</h2>

                <p>The American Elderberry drips with black berries in summer. Berries are commonly used to make wine, liqueurs &amp; pies. Two different varieties must be planted to provide pollination for fruit production. Portland Nursery carries 'Nova' &amp; 'York'. Leaves are medium green, flowers are creamy white.</p>

                <p>Grows 5-12' tall &amp; wider. Can be pruned &amp; kept on the smaller side. Prune in March.</p>

                <p>Hardy Z2 &ndash; some selections hardy to Z4.</p>

                <p><strong>Toxicity:</strong> Though the berries of native Sambucus are edible, they must be cooked first, as they frequently cause nausea and stomach upset when eaten raw.&nbsp; The leaves, woody stems and especially the roots are extremely toxic, due to the presence of cyanide-causing gliconides.</p>

                <h2>Elderberries for Ornament</h2>

                <figure><img src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/sambucus/Barred-Warbler-sambucus-nigra750.jpg" alt="Sambucus nigra"></figure>

                <h2><em>Sambucus nigra</em>: European or Common Elderberry.</h2>

                <p>This species offers a really wide range of leaf colors &amp; makes a great addition to the garden. The purple and green leaf forms are fast-growing to 8-12' tall with a strong vase-shape. They're self-sufficient &amp; easy to grow w/ few problems. Variegated (2-toned leaf) forms are a bit slower-growing with a bushier shape. They're susceptible to burning in hot afternoon sun so their ideal site is partly shaded.</p>

	                 <h2>Facts: Sambucus</h2>
                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Caprifoliaceae &ndash; Honeysuckle Family</p>
  <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Sambucus (sam-BOO-cus)</p>
  <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Elderberry</p>
  <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to the Americas, Europe, Asia, E &amp; NW Africa, E Australia &amp; Tasmania.  Two species are native to Oregon.</p>
  <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> About 25 species of shrubs, small trees &amp; perennial herbs.  Flowers are small &amp; white or pink, held in flat or round clusters.  Bloom is in mid-late spring.  Black, red or white fruit follows.  Leaves are deciduous, compound &amp; opposite &ndash; they have a feathery look &amp; come in many colors; green, white &amp; green, gold &amp; green, gold, purple.  Stems are thick, solid &amp; covered in dots (lenticels). </p>
  <p><strong>Size:</strong> In the Pacific Northwest, plants grow fast, mature around 8-12' tall &amp; wider.  Plants as large as 20' are common in their native habitats.</p>
    <p><strong>Culture:</strong>  Sun to part shade &ndash; full sun for best fruit production.  Moist soil, drought tolerant once established &ndash; still appreciate a nice deep drink in August.</p>
  <p><strong>Problems:</strong> We haven't observed pests or diseases on ours.  Plants can grow larger than anticipated &amp; are difficult to remove, so plan ahead &amp; allow appropriate space.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Native Elderberries</h3>
   <p>We are particularly lucky to host two species of native Elderberry: <strong><em>Sambucus caerulea &amp; Sambucus racemosa</em></strong>.  To read more about these species see our feature on the <a href="../natives/sambucus.shtml">Native Sambucus.</a></p>
