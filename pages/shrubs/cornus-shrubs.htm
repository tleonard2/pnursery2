<h2>CORNUS: Redtwig Dogwoods</h2>
<p><strong>Redtwig Dogwoods</strong> are at their best in winter after leaves have fallen and frosts have set in - this is when brightly colored decorative bark begins to glow. Branches vary in color from dark maroon to coral to yellow depending on species and cultivar.</p>

<p>Most have green leaves, but some varieties have bi-colored or multicolored leaves, which can really brighten up shady corners. Small white summer flowers occur in clusters and white or blue berries follow.</p>
<p>Typical redtwigs grow fast to 8-12&rsquo; tall and wide with dense branching and foliage, and some spread under ground forming multi-stemmed thickets. There are many lower-growing and better behaved forms available though. All varieties are tough, adapting to many different soils and light conditions and withstanding temperatures as low as -50 degrees.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cornus sericea &lsquo;Bailey&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Dark green leaves turn red &amp; purple before falling in autumn. Winter branches are deep purple. Growth is upright &amp; vigorous, but &lsquo;Bailey&rsquo; suckers less than the species.</p>
<p>Grows 8-10&rsquo; x 8-10&rsquo;.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Cornus sericea &lsquo;Cardinal&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Dark green leaves with nice fall color. Winter branches are bright coral pink, much brighter than most C. sericeas.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Cornus sericea &lsquo;Flaviramea&rsquo;</h2>
<figure><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/cornus_dogwood/cornus-sericea-Flaviramea500.jpg" alt="cornus-sericea-Flaviramea" /></figure>

<h2>Facts: Twig Dogwood</h2>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Cornaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Cornus alba, Cornus sanguinea, Cornus sericea (C. stolonifera)</p>
<p><strong>Common:</strong> Tatarian Dogwood, Bloodtwig Dogwood, Redtwig or Red Osier Dogwood</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Cornus alba &mdash; native to Siberia &amp; Northern China, Cornus sanguinea native to Europe &amp; Western Asia, Cornus sericea native to Oregon &amp; most of North America, excluding the south from Texas to Florida.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Three species of Cornus prized for brightly colored winter bark. Bark ranges from gold to red to black, but fades when temperatures warm in spring. Leaves are simple, some green &amp; others variegated with white, gold or pink. If planted in sun, many Twig Dogwoods have pretty red to purple fall color. Small white flowers occur in clusters and bloom in summer. White or purple berries follow in autumn. Most are multi-stemmed suckering shrubs (they send up new branches from the ground).</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Varies from 12&rdquo; to 12&rsquo; depending on variety.</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Sun, part shade. Prune oldest branches (or the whole plant if you wish to control height) to the ground in March to encourage new growth that colors well the following winter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cornus alba is best in moist well drained soil.</li>
<li>Cornus sanguinea requires well-drained soil.</li>
<li>Cornus sericea is very adaptable to differing soils and can even grow in standing water. It&rsquo;s often used in rain gardens.</li>
</ul>
<p>None should be planted close to a house because the root systems grow so quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Suckering (sending up multiple branches from the ground) is a problem if you wish to grow other plants close by. Black Spot &amp; Canker can be problems.</li>
<li>Black spot is treated by cleaning up fallen diseased leaves &amp; spraying bare branches with dormant spray. Also increased air circulation around the plant can help.</li>
<li>Canker should be pruned out if discovered. There is no treatment, but plants generate new branches from the ground, so they will usually recover. Read more about <a href="http://ppwsidlab.contentsrvr.net/details.pg_94EB41A3E5362B2F1A761F1A4FED0F12.vesh" target="_blank">Botryosphaeria Canker and Dieback</a></li>
<li>Branch color fading &mdash; old wood develops brown bark. Prune out oldest branches (or all branches) to the ground in March. They will grow back and be much more vibrant the following winter.</li>
</ul>
