<h2>CORNUS: Twig Dogwood Varieties</h2>

<img src="../images/cornus_dogwood/redtwigs500.jpg" alt="redtwigs500" width="500" height="274" />
<p><strong>Redtwig Dogwoods</strong> make up the most popular Dogwood shrubs.&nbsp;They show off brightly colored decorative bark in winter when many other  plants are resting. Twig color varies  from dark maroon to coral to yellow depending on species and variety.&nbsp; Most have green leaves with a few variegated  forms available.&nbsp; Small white flowers  occur in clusters in spring followed by white to blue fruit in late  summer.<p></p>

<p>Generally, <strong>Redtwig  Dogwoods</strong> grow fast to 8-12&rsquo; tall &amp; wide with dense branching and  foliage. A few lower-growing and dwarf  forms are available as well. Most grow  very fast, are very tough, adapting to many different soils and light  conditions and withstanding temperatures as low as -50 degrees.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>FACTS: TWIG DOGWOODS</h3>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Cornaceae</p>

<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Cornus alba, Cornus sanguinea, Cornus sericea (C. stolonifera)</p>

<p><strong>Common:</strong> Tatarian Dogwood, Bloodtwig Dogwood, Redtwig or Red Osier Dogwood</p>

<p><strong>Origin:</strong>  Cornus alba &amp;mdash; native to Siberia &amp; Northern China, Cornus sanguinea native to Europe &amp; Western Asia, Cornus sericea native to Oregon &amp; most of North America, excluding the south from Texas to Florida.</p>

<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong>  Three species of Cornus prized for brightly colored winter bark. Bark ranges from gold to red to black, but fades when temperatures warm in spring. Leaves are simple, some green &amp; others variegated with white, gold or pink. If planted in sun, many Twig Dogwoods have pretty red to purple fall color. Small white flowers occur in clusters and bloom in summer. White or purple berries follow in autumn. Most are multi-stemmed suckering shrubs (they send up new branches from the ground).</p>

<p><strong>Size:</strong>  Varies from 12&amp;rdquo; to 12&amp;rsquo; depending on variety.</p>

<p><strong>Culture:</strong>  Sun, part shade. Prune oldest branches (or the whole plant if you wish to control height) to the ground in March to encourage new growth that colors well the following winter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cornus alba is best in moist well drained soil. </li>
<li>Cornus sanguinea requires well-drained soil.</li>
<li>Cornus sericea is very adaptable to differing soils and can even grow in standing water. It&amp;rsquo;s often used in rain gardens.</li></ul>
<p>None should be planted close to a house because the root systems grow so quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Problems:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Suckering (sending up multiple branches from the ground) is a problem if you wish to grow other plants close by. Black Spot &amp; Canker can be problems. </li>
<li>Black spot is treated by cleaning up fallen diseased leaves &amp; spraying bare branches with dormant spray. Also increased air circulation around the plant can help. </li>
<li>Canker should be pruned out if discovered. There is no treatment, but plants generate new branches from the ground, so they will usually recover.

<li>Branch color fading &amp;mdash; old wood develops brown bark. Prune out oldest branches (or all branches) to the ground in March. They will grow back and be much more vibrant the following winter.</li>
