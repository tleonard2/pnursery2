<h2>The sweet smell that wafts through the air in February and March can be attributed to only a few plants, one of them being Daphne.</h2>
<p>An old garden favorite, Daphne odora, or Winter Daphne is a plant no yard should be without. While Winter Daphne is justly famous, she has a few sisters you should get to know.</p>
<h3>Here are some of our favorites:</h3>

<h2><em>Daphne bhoula</em>: Lokta or Paper Daphne</h2>
<p>Pale pink extremely fragrant flowers in late winter and long narrow evergreen leaves.</p>
<p>Grows to be very large, 8&rsquo; tall in Portland, 30&rsquo;+ in it&rsquo;s native Nepal where it is used as a plant for paper production. For more on paper production, see <a href="http://www.nepalipaper.com/1000883.html">Lokta Paper Craft</a>.</p>
<p>Sun-part shade, Z7-9</p>

<h2><em>Daphne odora: Winter Daphne</em></h2>
<p>Pink buds in January open to light pink flowers in February and March. The scent is so thick that on warmer days it can envelop a neighborhood. Leaves are evergreen &amp; leathery. There are many varieties of Daphne odora and all of them have the same beautifully scented flowers. The main difference is the leaf color, and there may be a slight difference in size as well - here are some of our favorites:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marginata&rsquo; has a slight cream-colored edge to the leaves. The new growth is heavy, so when it rains (as it does a lot in Portland) the branches splay a bit and lay down, which results in a plant that is very wide. A mature plant is 3-4' x 4-6'.</p>
<p>'Maijima' is a new introduction with thick creamy edges on the leaves. Reportedly it's a bit smaller - 3-4' x 3-4'.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Zuiko Nishiki&rsquo; has solid green leaves, and stiffer branching, so it's less likely to droop like 'Marginata'. Grows 4' x 4'.</p>
<p>All Winter Daphnes grow best in morning or dappled sun. It's enough light to produce good flowering but not so much that their leaves burn. In hot afternoon sun leaves look horrendous! Z7-9 &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Daphne &lsquo;Lawrence Crocker&rsquo; (<em>D. arbuscula x D. collina</em>)</h2>
<p>This little Daphne just gives and gives. Fragrant, purple/mauve flower clusters bloom from spring thru fall once the plant is established. Leaves are evergreen and narrow, about 1-2&rdquo; long. The plant is a nice little shrubby thing growing only to 12&rdquo;x12&rdquo;. It is the perfect addition to a rock garden or container. Adequate drainage in the soil is essential to survival, so allow for it and don't over-water.</p>
<p>Sun, part shade &ndash; zones 6-9&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Daphne transatlantica</em> (<em>D. caucasica x D. collina</em>)</h2>
<p>We may have saved the best for last. This is group of easy Daphnes! We carry several varieties of D. transatlantica - all have pale pink buds and white flowers that bloom several times each year, from April-October. They are semi-evergreen, so in warm winters they hold most of the leaves, but in harsher NW winters they'll shed part of the foliage. Some variation occurs in the leaves and growth habits - here's a synopsis.</p>
<p>'Eternal Fragrance' - Leaves are deep glossy green, 2" and convex. Flowers are a bit larger than other D. transatlanticas. Grows 2-3'x2-3'.</p>
<p>'Jim's Pride' - This variety can be hard to come by, but is worth listing. 'Jim's Pride' can be a little persnickety while getting established, but those who persever are rewarded with flowers for siz months, blue-green leaves and an easy-care plant that's around 4' x 4'.</p>
<p>'Summer Ice&rsquo; - Leaves have a creamy edge, adding to the frosty look year round. Blooms its heart out! Grows to about 3-4&rsquo; tall and wide.</p>
<p>Sun or part shade, appreciates improved drainage like any Daphne but thrives with a bit of neglect. Hardy in zones 5-9.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Facts: Daphne</h2>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Thymelaeaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Daphne&nbsp; DAFF-NEE</p>
<p><strong>Common:</strong> Daphne</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to Europe, North Africa, temperate and subtropical Asia</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Small flowers are usually fragrant and come in white, pink, lavender, yellow or chartreuse.&nbsp; Often flowers are produced in small clusters, sometimes grouped in masses along stem tips. Many species are evergreen, a few are deciduous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaves are simple, alternate, dark green to blue-green and sometimes variegated with white or cream. Plants form fleshy fruit that is <u>poisonous</u>, but can be decorative in red, orange, yellow or black.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Daphne are shrubs ranging in size from only 8&rdquo; high to 15&rsquo; tall in their native habitats.</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Typically Daphnes prefer much better soil drainage than our Portland clay or clay/rock blends provide. Amend planting beds with compost and add mulch yearly (make sure not to pile mulch around the base of the trunk), or plant Daphne in containers for assured success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Light requirements vary by species, so be sure to check plant tags before deciding on the location. Plants can suffer from over-watering or too much sunshine. Hardiness varies per species.</p>
<p><strong>Diseases:</strong> Daphne is primarily bug free in Portland. Problems come in the form of fungus. Root rot, crown rot, leaf-spotting are all fungal issues brought on by poor cultural conditions.&nbsp; Most of these problems can be avoided if drainage issues are addressed when planting.</p>
