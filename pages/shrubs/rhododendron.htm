	  <h2>DECIDOUS AZALEAS &amp; RHODODENDRONS</h2>

			<p>Rhododendrons and Azaleas have long been the go-to plant for northwest gardens.  They love it here, so it&rsquo;s an easy choice.  There is a large group of them however that has been overlooked for years; the ones that lose their leaves in winter.  Dramatic flower color and sweet perfume, lovely fall leaves and self-sufficiency are some of their best qualities.  Plus they thrive in sunshine while their evergreen relatives burn. </p>
	  <p>Many of the plants listed below were bred from Azaleas that are native to the United States.  Knapp Hill Nursery, Goldsworth Old Nursery and Exbury began to hybridize in the late 1800s using R. calendulaceum and R. arborescens (both native to eastern U.S.), R. occidentale (native to the Pacific Northwest), and R. molle (native to China).  Many of their hybrids are still sold today.  Locally Ivan and Robertha Arneson used those hybrids to breed new Azaleas into the 1990&rsquo;s.  Arneson Azlaeas are now some of the best and most popular on the market. </p>
	  <h3>The Difference between Azaleas and Rhododendrons</h3>
	    <ul>
	      <li>All Azaleas are members of the genus Rhododendron.</li>
	      <li>Deciduous Azaleas are in the subgenus Pentanthera,</li>
	      <li>Evergreen Azaleas are in the subgenus Tsustusti. </li>
	      <li>All Azaleas are elepidotes; they never have scales on the bottom side of their leaves.</li>
	      <li>Azaleas have 5 lobes on the flower.</li>
	      <li>Azaleas have hairs on their leaves that grow parallel to the leaf surface.	    </li>
   </ul>

   <h3>FACTS: RHODODENDRON</h3>
       <p><strong>Family:</strong> Ericaceae</p>
       <p><strong>Genus</strong>: Rhododendron</p>
       <p><strong>Common:</strong> Deciduous, Exbury, Mollis, Western, Sweet, Coast Azalea</p>
       <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Eastern &amp; Western North America, Asia &amp; Europe</p>
       <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> All Rhododendrons &amp; Azaleas included in this article lose their leaves during winter.  Flowers can be white, pink, yellow, orange, red or a combination of several colors.  Most are sweetly fragrant.  Some flowers are tube-shape, others are funnel-shape and some are double, having extra petals.  </p>
       <p><strong>Bloom</strong> is from late winter to mid spring. <br />
       Leaves open with the arrival of flowers or just following bloom.  Most are green but some are frosty blue-green and both types display excellent orange, red &amp; purple color before falling in autumn.  Some display bronze or red-tinged new leaf growth.          </p>
       <p><strong>Size:</strong> Most grow to around 4-5 feet tall x 5-6&rsquo; wide, but can get larger given time.</p>
       <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Unlike their evergreen relatives, Deciduous Azaleas and Rhododendrons thrive in full sun.   Part-shade to shade is fine too.  Plants grown in more shade will have an open airy shape and fewer flowers than plants grown with more light. </p>
       <p>Any Rhododendron or Azalea prefers well-drained soil with an acidic pH.  The Pacific Northwest naturally has soil with low pH because of the copious rain, but much of the area has heavy clay soil, so mixing compost to the bed before planting is advised.  Rhodies and Azaleas have shallow root systems and prefer not to be heavily mulched. </p>
       <p>Any fertilizer used should be specific to acid-loving plants, and directions should be followed carefully.</p>

         <p><strong>Problems:</strong> </p>

		<h3>Azalea Lace Bug</h3>
		<p>We&rsquo;ve created an article addressing this infestation problem.</p>
		<h4><a href="../../service/brochures/solutions/azaleabug.shtml" target="_blank">Treatment for Azalea Lace Bugs</a></h4>

		<p><strong>Powdery Mildew</strong></p>
         <p>Another enemy of the rhododendron is powdery mildew.  Most Deciduous Azaleas and Rhododendrons are subject to powdery mildew on the leaves during the warmth of summer. </p>
       <p>Options for combating this enemy are many and include:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Chemical warfare.  Synthetic and organic options are available and must be used often and without sympathy.</li>
         <li>Water leaves in the morning.  The idea is that the spores that make Powdery Mildew can be washed off.  If the leaves are wet during the night mildew spreads, so allow plenty of time for leaves to dry before nightfall.  This is not a fool-proof method, especially considering that rain cannot be controlled, but for those who prefer not to spray, it may be worth a try.</li>
         <li>Passive acceptance.  Powdery Mildew will not (usually) kill the plant.</li>
       </ul>
