<h2>In the dead of&nbsp;winter it is indeed a treat to see the vibrant tones of Hamamelis flowers dancing on unique zigzagging branches. Bright yellow, orange or red spidery flowers have a spicy fragrance that is enough to warm you from nose to toes!&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Witch Hazels develop nice green leaves where the crinkles of the veins look as though someone folded them perfectly across an axis. Autumn may really be the beginning of the season for Hamamelis&nbsp;however, because their leaves turn brilliant shades of yellow, orange, red or purple before falling to reveal their unique architectural structure.&nbsp;</p>
