                <h2>In later winter it is a rarity to see such vibrancy dancing on uniquely zigzagged branches. Witchhazels are one of the most architecturally sculpted trees when in bloom. The spicy fragrance is enough to get your bones warm in crispy weather.</h2>

                <p>On a winter day your senses light up with enjoyment to the arrays of radiant yellow, coppery orange, or dark red flowers to be viewed on an otherwise bleak winter landscape. It&rsquo;s like life awakens from a deep sleep to a bright path ahead.</p>

                <p>In summer most Witchhazels have a nice bluish green leaf where the crinkles of the veins look as though someone folded them perfectly across an axis. In fall many species continue to amaze me with their show of brilliant yellows, purples, oranges and reds mixed with greens. Be sure to include a Witchhazel as an element for a shrub border or an artistic specimen.</p>
