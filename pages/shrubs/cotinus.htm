                <h2>Most every one loves those deep shades of purple in the garden, but cannot seem to get enough of it. This can be a solution for those large spots in the garden that are missing something!</h2>

                <p>So many varieties of smoke trees are great for a quick fix. Their dense to graceful habits can achieve a screen size. They can also be cut back to the ground to rejuvenate very large colorful foliage.</p>

                <p>DISCLAMER: If you have a smoke tree don&rsquo;t call the fire department when it is blooming. Their very delicate tiny flowers are in 6&rdquo; tall clusters that cover the shrub to small tree, making the appearance of a blur which can resemble smoke. After you have enjoyed them in summer take a breather because there fall color is absolutely something to write home about. Many varieties explode with bright orange red to yellow fall colors.</p>
