<h2>COTINUS: Smoke Tree </h2>

			<p>Most every one loves  those deep shades of purple in the garden, but cannot seem to get enough of it.  This can be a solution for those large spots in the garden that are missing  <strong>something!</strong></p>
			<p>So many varieties<strong> </strong>of smoke trees are great for a quick  fix. Their dense to graceful habits can achieve a screen size. They can also be  cut back to the ground to rejuvenate very large colorful foliage. </p>
			<p>DISCLAMER: If  you have a smoke tree don&rsquo;t call the fire department when it is blooming. Their  very delicate tiny flowers are in 6&rdquo; tall clusters that cover the shrub to  small tree, making the appearance of a blur which can resemble smoke. After you  have enjoyed them in summer take a breather because there fall color is  absolutely something to write home about. Many varieties explode with bright  orange red to yellow fall colors.</p>
