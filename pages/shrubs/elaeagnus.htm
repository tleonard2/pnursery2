                <p>Grown for red berries that taste like pie cherries, Goumi Berries have sweet smelling white flowers in May and are easy to care for, bug &amp; disease resistant shrubs. Plants are self-fertile but will produce more if planted with another variety. Berries ripen in July. (Photo credit to One Green World).</p>

                <p>Autumn Olive is not related to true olives, which depending on how you feel about olives could be a good or bad thing. This has nutrient rich red or amber berries in September and fragrant white flowers in May. It's self fertile, cold hardy and reports to improve soils where it's planted.</p>
