                     <p>Try growing one with a shrub or small tree so that when the clematis is in bloom the tree (or shrub) appears to be blooming. With over 200 species and a variety of growth habits, Clematis make versatile additions to any garden. Most have showy flowers, large in proportion to the size of the plant, that range in nearly every color from white, cream, yellow through pink, red, rich magenta into pal blues, lilac, and dark purple. </p>

<p>With its versatility and wide range of colors, you are sure to find one that fits perfectly into your landscape!</p>

	                <h3>Clematis Culture</h3>
					<p><strong>Family:</strong> Ranunculaceae</p>

					<p><strong>Genus:</strong>  <em>Clematis</em></p>

<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Mainly of Chinese and Japanese origin.</p>

<p><strong>Culture</strong>: Clematis can be planted anytime the ground is workable. Because they are such long-lived plants, it is essential to site and plant them appropriately. Clematis require at least 5-6 hours of full sun, or all day filtered sun. They prefer rich, loose, well drained soil. A cool root zone is essential, so use rocks, mulch or groundcover to provide shade. To support their climbing habits, always provide a shrub, tree or trellis for climbing.</p>

<p><strong>Fertilizing:</strong>When growth begins in spring apply a balanced fertilizer. Later when actively growing, a general purpose liquid fertilizer (such as 5-10-10) works well. Once the flower buds are well formed, stop fertilizing until after flowering to prolong the bloom time. To help plants settle down for winter, discontinue fertilizing in mid-August. </p>

<p><strong>Watering:</strong> Water your new Clematis freely and often in the first year. After the first year soak the roots well once a week during dry weather.</p>

<p><strong>Planting:</strong> Dig a hole about 18 inches deep and wide. Mix 1/3 compost, rotted manure, and /or pumice in to the backfill to loosen heavy soil. Be sure to remove the stake which is usually stapled to the pot. Place the clematis in the hole about 2 inches below the soil line, being very careful not to damage the brittle stems. Backfill with amended soil to the base of the plant stem.</p>

<p>Leave the final filling of the hole until later in the season to avoid rotting out the crown. Securely attach the stems to a support to prevent damage throughout the growing season. Note that may varieties of clematis are excellent subjects for large containers, as long as the roots stay cool.</p>

	<h3>Proper Pruning</h3>
<p><strong>Pruning:</strong> The proper pruning of Clematis causes many gardeners high anxiety. Note that improper pruning will never kill a Clematis, it merely leads to delayed flowering. And if never pruned at all, they will still flower well, just mostly at the to leaving the lower branches "leggy."</p>

<p>Where the vines flower determines how and when they should be pruned. Those that bloom only on growth produced the previous year should be lightly cut back as soon as they finish blooming in May or June.</p>

<p>Those that flower in spring on last year's growth, <em>then again in fall on this year's growth</em> should be lightly pruned in late February or March. </p>

<p>*Keeping a garden journal is very helpful in remembering details from year to year. </p>

<p>Clematis that bloom in nearly summer to fall on the current year's growth tend to become quite leggy, with flowers occurring progressively higher, leaving much of the vine naked. These vines can be trained up into a tree where their growth habit works well.</p>

<p>Failing that, they should be aggressively cut back in late February or March to two strong sets of buds on each stem as close to the ground as possible. This will ensure a compact vine with flowers at eye level.</p>
