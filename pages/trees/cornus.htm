              <h2>CORNUS: Dogwood</h2>

   <p>One of the most  anticipated signs of spring in Portland  is our flowering trees. In May,  flowering Cherry and Plum trees conclude their  reign, making way for our magnificent Dogwoods.&nbsp;Today, May 1, white and pink flowers dot the city, insisting that spring  rain gives up and makes room for sunshine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There is more to  Dogwoods than trees though. Cornus, the  Dogwood genus hosts tough shrubs and sweet groundcovers that thrive in our  climate. </p>

       <p><strong><em>Cornus nuttallii</em> - Pacific  Dogwood</strong> &ndash; Our native Dogwood tree that blooms with brilliant white flowers  in April-May, and often surprises with a second bloom in autumn! Cornus nuttallii is notorious for being  difficult to grow in captivity, so it is very hard to find in nurseries. Portland Nursery is able to supply a few  small sizes, plus several named cultivars that have been easier for growers to  work with. </p>

<h3>Shrubs and Perennials</h3>
  <p><strong>Redtwig Dogwoods</strong> make up the most popular Dogwood shrubs.&nbsp;They show off brightly colored decorative bark in winter when many other  plants are resting. Twig color varies  from dark maroon to coral to yellow depending on species and variety.&nbsp; Most have green leaves with a few variegated  forms available.&nbsp; Small white flowers  occur in clusters in spring followed by white to blue fruit in late  summer.<p></p>
<p>Generally, <strong>Redtwig  Dogwoods</strong> grow fast to 8-12&rsquo; tall &amp; wide with dense branching and  foliage. A few lower-growing and dwarf  forms are available as well. Most grow  very fast, are very tough, adapting to many different soils and light  conditions and withstanding temperatures as low as -50 degrees.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here are some of  our favorites. </p>

It prefers  full or partial shade. Flowers are  dainty and white, blooming in spring.  Green leaves emerge in April and die down to the ground after frost.

      <h3>FACTS: CORNUS</h3>
      <p><strong>Family: </strong>Cornaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus: </strong>Cornus</p>
    <p><strong>Common: </strong>Dogwood</p>
    <p><strong>Origin: </strong>45-50 species native to Asia, Europe and North   America.&nbsp; Several species  are native to the Pacific Northwest.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> The genus is made up of trees, shrubs and  herbaceous plants. Flowers are borne in  clusters that are sometimes surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Often the bracts are confused with flowers as they are brightly colored and showy in spring.</p>
    <p><strong>Leaves</strong> are opposite except for Cornus alternifolia and Cornus controversa.&nbsp; Variegated leaf-forms exist but most species  have medium green leaves that turn red &amp; purple in autumn.</p>
    <p><strong>Fruit</strong> is 2 seeded and ranges in color from white to pink to red.</p>
    <p><strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp; Tree-form Dogwoods  range in size from 15&rsquo; to 35&rsquo; tall</p>
    <p>Shrub-form Dogwoods range from 12&rdquo;  to 15&rsquo; tall</p>
    <p>Herbaceous Dogwoods &ndash; 3-6&rdquo; tall  forming a mat</p>
    <p><strong>Culture: </strong>&nbsp;Cultural  needs vary widely.</p>
    <p><strong>Success with Dogwood trees</strong> - Many Dogwood trees grow as under story  trees in their native habitats, thriving with filtered sunlight and soil that  has built perfect structure after years of leaves and needles dropping and  composting on the forest floor.&nbsp; It is  rare to find such conditions within city limits.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>For best results:  </strong></p>
    <p><strong>1. Site</strong> the tree in a spot that gets       sunshine in the morning &amp; shade in the afternoon. Too much shade will inhibit flowering       and fall color, too much sun can burn leaves. If you ignore this and choose a spot       with full sun, realize that the tree will require more water in summer and       may have scorched leaves.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Mix compost</strong> and EB Stone Sure Start Fertilizer into the soil when planting.&nbsp; </p>
    <p><strong>3. Add water</strong> even if it&rsquo;s raining.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Add a layer</strong> of mulch over the surface of the roots, taking care to leave the trunk clear.</p>
    <p><strong>5, During the first year</strong> the tree will require regular irrigation. Water deeply for 20-30 minutes, enough to soak the root system. Water infrequently, maybe twice a week when temperatures are in the 80-90 degree range. More if temperatures are hotter, less if it is colder. Soaker hoses and Tree Gators.work well to provide slow-release deep watering. When tree roots are established, they require less irrigation. See <a href="http://www.treegator.com/home/" target="_blank">Tree Gators</a></p>
    <p class="sidebody"><strong>6. Lawn watering </strong>that is daily and shallow is not appropriate for establishing healthy root systems in trees.</p>
    <p class="sidebody"><strong>Diseases:</strong>&nbsp; Dogwoods  are prone to several fungal diseases. <a href="http://plant-disease.ippc.orst.edu/plant_index.cfm" target="_blank">The Oregon   State University  website</a> has great disease photos and information for treatment.</p>
