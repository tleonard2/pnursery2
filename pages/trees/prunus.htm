<h4>Prunus is a huge group of trees and shrubs that includes many of our favorite spring-flowering trees and arguably our tastiest fruits. Peaches, plums, nectarines, cherries and almonds are all different species of Prunus.</h4>

<p>The glorious flowering cherry trees that dot Portland&rsquo;s Waterfront Park welcoming spring are a fabulous example.  This article covers the species grown for ornamental use.  </p>
  <p>You'll some of our favorites below:</p>

<h3><a id="cherries"></a>Flowering Cherries: </h3>

      <hr/>
      <p><strong>Bitter Cherry <em>P. emarginata</em></strong> &ndash; Native to the Northwest.  White flowers with notched petals bloom in late winter, red bitter berries in summer are good for wildlife.  Dark green leaves are lighter underneath.  Plants grow into a small tree or large shrub, 7-50&rsquo; tall, depending on their culture.  Roots are very wide-spreading, often forming suckers far from the original tree.  In the wild they often form thickets.</p>

       <hr/>

     <p><strong>&lsquo;Pendula  or &lsquo;Pendula Double&rsquo;</strong> &ndash; Pink flowers in March are single or double and lightly fragrant.  Weeping branches are usually grafted to a 4 or 6&rsquo; trunk and grow out and down to the ground, with gradual mounding adding height gradually.  In 10 years trees are about 12-15&rsquo; tall x 10-12&rsquo; wide, but in time branches will form some upright growth and trees can reach 30&rsquo; tall x 40&rsquo; wide.

In 1912, the mayor of Tokyo gifted 900 Yoshinos to the USA, which were planted in Washington D.C.  Clusters of small flowers are pale pink in bud and white when open.  Flowers open before green leaves fill-in.  Leaves turn lovely yellow and peach in autumn before falling.  Young trees grow very fast and develop thick trunks quickly.  Trees mature around 40-50&rsquo; tall.</p>

       <hr/>

     <p><strong>&lsquo;Akebono&rsquo; </strong>&ndash; Akebono Cherries are planted around Oregon&rsquo;s capital building in Salem.  Their flowers and shape are very similar to Yoshino but their form is smaller, making it a more manageable city tree.  It matures around 25&rsquo; x 25&rsquo;.</p>

  <p><img src="../images/prunus/prcerasifera-osu350.jpg" width="360" height="272" alt="Purple leaf plum" /></p><p class="clear"><strong>Flowering Purple-leaf Plums <em>P. cerasifera</em></strong> &ndash; One of the first trees to bloom in spring with pretty pink flowers.  Green-leaved forms exist, but the most ornamental forms have dark purple leaves.  Most forms develop a red, yellow or purple fruit that is edible, but is usually left for birds.  Many cultivated varieties exist, differing mostly in their overall shape.  All types are subject to problems with shot-hole fungus in the leaves and serious aphid problems.  Without treatment an aphid infestation will cause considerable dropping of sticky aphid dew on whatever is parked beneath the tree.  All are best in full sun and hardy to Z5.</p>

       <hr/>

     <p><strong>Purple-leaf Sand Cherry <em>P. x cistena</em></strong><em></em> &ndash; A hybrid between P. cerasifera and P. pumila.  Flowers and leaves are the same as tree-form plums, but this is a shrub.  It grows in an upright, multi-stemmed dense shape to 6-10&rsquo;.  It likes full sun, and is super hardy to Z3. </p>

                        <h3>Facts: Prunus</h3>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Rosaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Prunus (pr-OO-nus)</p>
<p><strong>Common:  </strong>Cherry, Plum, Peach, Almond, Apricot, Nectarine, Laurel</p>
<p><strong>Origin:  </strong>Over 400 species of trees and shrubs from temperate northern climates world-wide.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Flowers are usually white, sometimes pink, usually with 5 petals.  Those with more petals are called &lsquo;double&rsquo;.  Some flowers, like those on Laurels are held in spikes, or vertical clusters.  Many are sweetly fragrant.  Fruit is fleshy and single seeded.  Leaves are sometimes evergreen but mostly deciduous.  Some Prunus that lose their leaves have nice peachy-orange fall color, but most have insignificant fall interest.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Shrubs are usually large, growing above 6&rsquo; tall.  Trees vary by species.  The smallest dwarf Peach trees are mature at just 3&rsquo; tall, and the largest Cherries and Laurels are 40&rsquo; and taller.</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Excellent soil drainage is imperative when growing any type of Prunus.  Excellent soil drainage means creating a situation where water flows through the soil allowing roots a nice drink.  If soil becomes water-logged, roots cannot breathe and will rot.  If water runs across the top of the soil without sinking in, like on a slope, roots cannot access enough water.</p>
<p>Improve soil be blending compost into a wide planting area.  Pumice can also be added to sites that are very dense, or to make a bed for particularly testy plants.</p>
<p><strong>Plums, Cherries and Laurels</strong> are among the more tolerant species of our PNW heavy clay soils.  Peaches, Nectarines, Apricots and Almonds are among the more difficult species to grow in our climate.  Peaches and Nectarines thrive east of the Cascades where rain is less plentiful, soil is more alkaline and naturally better draining. </p>
<p>To grow Peaches and other difficult species successfully west of the Cascades, create an environment that is drier during winter months.  Growing in containers, under a south-facing eve for example, will allow for enough sun and will limit moisture while providing good soil drainage and a neutral pH.</p>
<p>For more information on growing fruit trees, follow this link to <a href="../fruits/index.shtml">Portland Nursery&rsquo;s fruit page.</a><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Light:</strong> Full sun, at least 6 hours per day, preferably during the warmest part of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Problems:</strong> Problems are touched-on briefly in the culture section of this page.  There are many other concerns though.</p>
<p>Overgrowth = Over-Work  English Laurel grows very fast and will out-grow a spot in no time, requiring pruning several times a year to keep it in check.</p>
<p>Birds like the fruit  If trees are planted to provide fruit, cherries for instance, they may need to be protected from birds, critters like raccoons and insects that appreciate tasty fruit just as much as you do.</p>
<p><strong>Fungal diseases:</strong> All Prunus are prone to fungal problems.  Some, like Shot Hole Fungus, cause just cosmetic damage, where others cause damage to the fruit and leaves, and may ultimately cause the death of the tree.</p>
<p><a href="http://plant-disease.ippc.orst.edu/disease.cfm?RecordID=270">Follow this link to see various diseases that affect Cherry trees.</a></p>
<p><strong>Fruit-drop</strong> &ndash; Many trees sold for pretty spring flowers develop fruit in summer.  Often the fruit drops onto sidewalks and lawns making a sticky mess.</p>

<h3>Facts: prunus</h3>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Adoxaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> prunus (vi-BURR-num)</p>
<p><strong>Common:</strong> Arrowwood, Wayfaring Tree</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Temperate North &amp; South America, Asia &amp; Europe</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Over 150 species of shrubs and small trees. Flowers are sometimes fragrant, sometimes stinky or without scent. Pink or white flowers in clusters (umbrella shape, snowball shape, lacecap shape) bloom from mid-winter into June. Blue, red, white or yellow fruits occur in autumn, adding another season of interest &amp; feeding birds at the same time. Leaves are evergreen or deciduous, opposite &amp; occasionally in whorls of 3, lance-shaped, maple shaped, heart-shaped or round, with straight, undulating or serrated edges. Many deciduous prunuss have pretty red, orange or purple fall color. It&rsquo;s a huge group of plants with a lot of variety!</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Size varies by species and cultivar. Smallest are 2-3&rsquo; at maturity. Many grow to 10-15&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong>  Varies by species &mdash; most prefer sun-part shade. Many adapt to differing soil types, but prefer clay soils to be amended to assist with drainage issues. Cold tolerance varies - less hardy types grow best if shielded from cold wind in winter.</p>
<p><strong>Problems:</strong>  Powdery mildew is the most common problem for prunus. Tips for avoiding it:
Air circulation &mdash; don&rsquo;t over crowd plants, allow for air circulation.
Cleaning &mdash; remove the worst of the leaves &amp; rake up fallen leaves in autumn.
Mulch &mdash; adding mulch twice a year covers spores that may be lingering on the soil surface, increases air circulation in the soil as particles break down, and helps to keep soil moisture even.</p>
