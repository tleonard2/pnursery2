<h2>Perennials come back year after year, bringing seasonal color to your garden. &nbsp;They can add fragrance, attract wild life and create rhythmic change.</h2>
<h3>Most perennials bloom for a two to three month period, with a handful of long season bloomers out there. &nbsp;Refer to our perennial bloom calender to help you plan a year full of perennial color. &nbsp;Not only do perennnials offer a wide array of flower colors and form but they can also add structure and texture with their foliage and growth habits. &nbsp;Tall, spikey Delphinium add spots of colorful vertical punctuation in a sunny boarder. &nbsp;Where as the robust leaves of hostas add a lush, dense feel. &nbsp;Wheather you are planting containers or in the ground, there is sure to be a perennial or two to fit your garden's needs.</h3>
<h3><strong>Our website contains a perennial library in progress. &nbsp;New varieties are continually arriving at the nursery. &nbsp;Generally we have the bestt selection of plant when it is in bloom. &nbsp;Since inventory changes daily, please contact us for the current availbility.</strong></h3>
<p>Planting Tips:</p>
<p>*Plants requiring full sun need at least six hours of direct sun per day at peak season.</p>
<p>*Shade perennials have a huge range of light needs. &nbsp;Make sure to check if a plant can take full shade if your area does not recieve any direct sun.</p>
<p>*Most, if not all perennials prefer ammended soil. &nbsp;This means adding 1-3" of compost to the planting area (depending on original soil structure). &nbsp;</p>
<p>* Use plants that require the same kind of light, water and soil.</p>
<p>*It is common to plant perennials in odd numbers, though not required. &nbsp;Your garden is your own work of art and learning experience.</p>
<p>*Perennials generally take one to two full years to establish.</p>
