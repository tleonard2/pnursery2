                    <h2>Although not a true grass, mondo grass resembles one. It has re-curved thick blades, grows and spreads in tufts, can be used as a turf substitute (no mowing though). </h2>
	                    <p>It grows from 3-12' tall-depending on variety. The flowers are tiny, pale lavender and bloom on stalks nestled in the leaves in summer.</p>

                    <p>Smaller varieties of this tough plant are perfect for anywhere you just want luscious green. It works great as a groundcover, in pots, or as an edging plant for pathways and features. The other striking version <strong><em>(O. 'nigrescens')</em></strong> we see of this plant is one of the blackest colored plants you can get- really fun and unique in combinations or as an accent.</p>

                    <p>This versatile creature will handle a variety of sun or shade conditions and a range of moisture situations but is not flexible about its dislike of the combination of excessive water and bad drainage. Its beautiful and graceful evergreen nature is an addition to any style of garden from extreme modern to low maintenance to cottage style.</p>

                    <p>Some varieties you can find at Portland Nursery include:</p>
