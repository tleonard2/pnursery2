                    <p>The genus <em>Carex</em> is a member of the sedge family and is a large genus with over 1,000 different species found throughout the world. They are a part of the same family as <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, the plant the ancient Egyptians used to make paper.</p>

                    <p>They look like grasses, but botanically are called sedges because of certain features. A little rhyme goes &ldquo;sedges have edges&hellip;&rdquo; because some of them have sharp cutting edges and the stems make a triangular cross-section. Also, unlike the ornamental grasses, the flowers of sedges are generally insignificant, so they are chiefly foliage plants.</p>

                    <p><em>Carex</em> form clumps or tufts of grass-like foliage which comes in a range of colors from greens, blues, yellows, browns, oranges and some striking variegations.</p>

                    <p>Because this is such a large genus, there is a wide variety of appearances among the <em>Carex</em>. Some are very upright with leaves that curl at the tips, while others will be low and mounding with long flowing leaves that look like a waterfall spilling over a wall.</p>

                    <p>Some <em>Carex</em> spread by rhizomes that will slowly creep along the ground and make good ground-cover options, although none are invasive or aggressive. A gardener can find a <em>Carex</em> for sun or shade, for a boggy area or a dry spot.</p>

                    <p>Because they are evergreen they are great choices for year-round interest in the garden and they also make fantastic container plants either as a focal point or an accent.</p>

                <h2>FACTS: Carex</h2>

                <p><strong>Family:</strong> <em>Cyperaceae</em></p>

                <p><strong>Genus:</strong> <em>Carex</em></p>

                <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Found throughout the world.&nbsp; Many are native to northern temperate regions, although many of the garden cultivars originate from New Zealand native species.</p>

                <p><strong>Culture:</strong> <em>Carex</em> are very easy grass-like plants like tend to like damp, sunny locations although some will adapt to dry garden conditions and some species can handle some shade.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Pests and Diseases</strong>:&nbsp; None here in the Pacific Northwest, although some of the brown-leaved species from New Zealand are susceptible to root-mealy bugs in hot climates</p>

                <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Most <em>Carex</em> species are evergreen so it is a good idea to periodically cut them back in the spring to rejuvenate the plant and remove winter damaged foliage.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>For deciduous species cut back old growth in spring when you see the new growth starting.</p>

                <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Divide clumps in late spring.</p>
