                        <h2>What a lawn likes:</h2>

                        <p>Knowing what a lawn likes goes a long way to creating that great looking patch of green.</p>

                        <ul class="lefttext">
                            <li>Soil pH of 6.5-7</li>

                            <li><strong>Lime 5lbs. per 100 square feet, twice a year.</strong>  Our rainy climate leaves soil with a low pH, making it hard for lawn grass to pick up the nutrition it needs to thrive. Raise the pH by adding lime twice a year and your lawn will be much healthier.Lawn</li>

                            <li><strong>Water 1&quot; per week</strong> In summer, watering this much will allow the lawn to go dormant, which is healthy. Letting the lawn grow taller in hot summer months, 3-4&quot; keeps it looking greener.</li>

                            <li><strong>Fertilize 3x per yea</strong>r with organic fertilizer or 4x per year with synthetic fertilizer. Start in March, finish in September.</li>
                        </ul>

	                      <h3>Starting a New Lawn: Seed or Sod?</h3>

                        <p>Both are good options. Sod is instant lawn!! Seed is more cost effective but takes time. Which ever route you choose, soil preparation is a very important step and is the same for both methods.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Roto-till when the soil is not too wet.</li>

                            <li>Add compost to help increase drainage (air and water flow) through the soil.</li>

                            <li>Add lime to raise the pH level, 5lbs. per 100 square feet</li>

                            <li>Use the roto-tiller to blend lime and compost</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Lawn from Seed</h4>

                        <p>We carry a nice variety of high quality seed mixes blended for Pacific Northwest conditions.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Water Warden &ndash; slow-grow, low water option</li>

                            <li>Envirolawn &ndash; blend of grass, clover and flower seeds</li>

                            <li>Sun, shade or blended sun and shade</li>
                        </ul>

                           <h3>Lawn Renovation</h3>

                <ul class="lefttext">
<li>Remove moss &ndash; use a moss killer &amp; rake out the remains once moss has turned black (about 2 weeks).</li>

                <li>Remove or kill weeds</li>

                <li>Remove thatch using a thatch rake. This will also rough the surface of the soil for planting.</li>

                <li>Aerate soil if the ground is poorly drained. Use compost or pumice to fill aeration holes.</li>

                <li>Add soil in low parts of the lawn to level the planting area.</li>

                <li>Add lime, 5lbs. per 100 sq. ft.</li>

                <li>Sow seed using a seed blend that suits your sun exposure. Use a seed broadcaster at a rate of 3lbs. per 100 sq. ft.</li>

                <li>Fertilize following the directions on your fertilizer package.</li>

                <li>Cover seed lightly with compost, no thicker than 1/8&quot; to protect from birds &amp; erosion.</li>

                <li>Water, keeping seed consistently moist.</li>

                <li>Mow when grass is 1 &frac12;&quot; tall.</li></ul>
