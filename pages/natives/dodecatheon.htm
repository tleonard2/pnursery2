	    	<h2>Unusual, recurved flowers in electric hues make Dodecatheon look like the shooting stars of their common name.</h2>

			<p>Arching clusters of purple/pink petals flying out behind a bright yellow base and dark flower tube, look not unlike a thrown dart or pointy badminton bird making its descent. Because this is on a somewhat miniature scale (the petals are only ¼ - ¾” long) the effect isn’t cloying or overwhelming in the garden, but is instead an intriguing sight in spring! </p>			<p>Dodecatheon can be found throughout most of North America, and there are several species native to Oregon: <em>D. alpinum, D. austrofrigidum, D. conjugens, D. dentatum</em> (white flowering), <em>D. hendersonii, D. jeffreyi, D. poeticum</em> and <em>D. pulchellum</em>. Some are more obscure, and in a few cases endangered.</p>
 			<p><em>Dodecatheon hendersonii, poeticum</em> and <em>pulchellum</em> are most commonly available in nurseries. </p>

                    <p>This is the Shooting Star frequently found in the cool, moist, shady areas of the Willamette Valley and into the lower elevations of the Cascade Range. In leaf March to July, it flowers generally April to June on slender stalks rising 12-18” above the basal leaf cluster, with 4-5 of the distinctive and bright flower nodding above. Brings a splash of color to the cool, mossy greens of the woodland garden. Summer dormant.</p>

                     <h2><em>D. poeticum:</em> Poet’s Shooting Star</h2>

                    <p>This species of <em>Dodecatheon</em> is found almost in every county in Oregon, and generally is widespread throughout the region. This is the Shooting Star of more open, sunny areas and drier woodlands.  In the wild it is often found along seepages and other areas that give abundant springtime moisture followed by necessary dry conditions in summer, when the <em>D. poeticum</em> is dormant. The flowers (generally 5) cluster at the top of the slender flowering stem, but this one is shorter, rising only 2-10” above the leaves.</p>

                    <p>This may be the Shooting Star best suited for the rock garden or container garden; though it grows in a variety of conditions, it is the one found in sub-alpine meadows – suggesting the need for better than average drainage to help protect it from our soggy winters. As the common name describes, the small flowers that gracefully float 12-18” above the foliage generally number only three per stalk.</p>

	                    <h2>FACTS: Dodecatheon</h2>
				          <p><strong>Family: </strong>Primulaceae </p>
				          <p><strong>Genus:</strong> &nbsp;Dodecatheon</p>
				          <p><strong>Common name: </strong>Shooting Star</p>
				          <p><strong>Native Range: </strong>In our region, widespread from British  Columbia south into California, in many different habitats and elevations.</p>
				          <p><strong>Characteristics: </strong>&nbsp;Basel clump of oval leaves, wiry  flowering stem rising above. Flowers in  few to several to a cluster; pink to magenta to lavender petals that are  sharply recurved backward, similar in style to cyclamen. Spreads and colonizes from the base and from  self-seeding.</p>
				          <p><strong>Culture: </strong>During spring blooming season, soil should be moist and well-drained. Dodecatheon goes dormant in summer (leaves disappear) and it is important to reduce/withhold watering during this period.  Over watering and poor drainage, especially in winter, is the most likely culprit if your Dodecatheon doesn’t reemerge in the spring.</p>						  <p><strong>Light:</strong> Sun/shade, depending on the species</p>
				          <p><strong>Pests/Diseases: </strong>Virtually pest and disease free.&nbsp; </p>
