	    			<h2>Our native of the Buckthorn family, <em>Rhamnus purshiana,</em> is a real &ldquo;sleeper&rdquo; among our native trees -- frequently overlooked and underappreciated.</h2>

                    <p>Yet it is a widely-adaptable small tree that is a favorite for birds and suitable for the smaller urban garden; growing as a shrub to about 15 feet, it can also reach 30 feet as a small tree.</p>

                    <p>Described once as looking like &ldquo;an alder crossed with a birch with a cherry thrown in&rdquo; -- the Cascara&rsquo;s mottled gray bark is topped with deeply-ridged, oval leaves usually dark green on their topside with lighter green underneath.</p>

                     </figure>

                    <p class="clear">Depending on the amount of sun it&rsquo;s grown in, the fall color can range from yellow to orange - red in the fall. The flowers are small, creamy greenish-white, generally hiding amongst the foliage in small clusters. Butterflies like them, however, and will seek them out. The fruit that follows are small, purple-black beads that attract many species of birds.</p>

                    <p>Cascara grows in a wide variety of conditions &ndash; wet to dry, sun to shade &ndash; though it will perform best in a partly sunny, moist site with well-drained soil. That being said, it will happily take summer dry conditions, making it an appropriate site for seasonally wet areas like a rain garden.</p>

                    <p>Although aphids can sometimes be a pest of Cascara, and its foliage has been noted to be susceptible to Phytophthora, it seems that it tends to be mostly problem-free; and all of its virtues of adaptability, seasons of beauty and attractiveness to birds far outweigh the risks.</p>

	                    <h2>FACTS: Rhamnus purshiana</h2>
                <p><strong>Family:</strong> Rhamnaceae</p>

                <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Rhamnus</p>

                <p><strong>Common name:</strong> Cascara, Cascara Buckthorn</p>

                <p><strong>Native Range:</strong> British Columbia south to California, primarily west of the Cascades</p>

                <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Grows as a tall shrub to small tree, 15-30&rsquo;. Gray bark; oval, large ribbed leaves that are dark green when they emerge, turning yellow to orange-red in fall; small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by purplish-black fruit much loved by birds.</p>

                <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Takes sun or shade, preferring a mix of both. Prefers moist to wet, well-draining soil; but is also tolerant of summer-dry conditions.</p>

                <p><strong>Pests/Diseases:</strong> Aphids are sometimes a problem; does not thrive as vigorously in areas of high-pollution. In general, however, Cascara is fairly problem-free.</p>
