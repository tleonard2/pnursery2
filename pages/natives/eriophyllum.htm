	    			<h2>Eriophyllum lanatum is an easy-going native perennial, bothered by almost nothing except too much water. Want something for that sunny spot beyond the reach of your irrigation? This might be just what you need.</h2>

<p>A highly variable plant, depending largely on growing conditions, it can range from four to twenty-four inches in height, in a garden setting typically reaching somewhere in the middle. Delicately and deeply lobed leaves are a grayish green, all the more 'wooly' in appearance due to their covering by soft white hairs. </p>
<p>This grayish hue is the perfect foil for the dazzlingly bright yellow of the daisy like flowers – in the same way that an overcast day highlights the colors in the garden – which freely cover the plant in a long bloom time, generally May into July. These bright and cheery flowers attract numerous species of beneficial insects and butterflies.</p>
<p>This is one plant that Willamette Valley gardeners could easily kill with kindness. It's at home in dry, rocky conditions; drought tolerant in a big way once established, it is best to think of this plant in a rock garden, trough, or in that almost-nothing-will-grow-there parking strip.</p>

<p>Too much water and/or too little drainage will prove its demise. It won't even tolerate much in the way of summer water unless the drainage is excellent.</p>
	<p>Alternately, it might be one of those plants best kept in a container and pulled under the protection of house eaves or porch overhang during our wetter months. (Think Lewisia, Penstemon, etc.)Full sun to light shade suit Eriophyllum best.</p>
<p>A great addition to help attract butterflies and numerous beneficial insects to your garden, and make you feel just a little bit sunnier, regardless of the weather!</p>

	                    <h2>FACTS: Eriophyllum</h2>
				          <p><strong>Family:</strong> Asteraceae </p>
						    <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Eriophyllum</p>
						    <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Oregon sunshine, wooly sunflower</p>
						    <p><strong>Origin:</strong> semi-desert and other rocky, arid places at low and mid-altitude locations throughout western North America </p>
						    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Clumps of green, deeply lobed leaves are covered with fine white hairs, giving the foliage a soft, grayed appearance that sets off the bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that appear in spring and continue well into summer. Plants grow 4-24&quot; tall, depending on conditions.  Attractive to several species of butterflies.</p>
						    <p><strong>Culture: </strong>This plant thrives in full sun to light shade, and very well-drained rocky/sandy/dry soil. Drought-tolerant, will accept some summer water only if drainage is excellent.  Can be propagated easily from seed gathered in the fall.</p>
						    <p><strong>Pests/Diseases:</strong> <em>Eriophyllum</em> is considered disease-resistant. Its leaves sometimes experience damage from insects, but not very common.</p>
