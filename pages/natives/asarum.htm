	    <h2>Our native ginger is one of our most beautiful woodland groundcovers, best enjoyed for its mostly evergreen carpet of deep green heart-shaped (fragrant!) leaves, not to mention the unusual, other-worldly purplish-brown cupped flowers with long mousy tails extending from three flower lobes that hide and peek out from the foliage.</h2>

			<p>While <em>A. caudatum</em> is by far the most common native species of wild ginger, there is a second worth mentioning: <em>A. marmoratum</em> is a beautiful but fairly obscure species that is found in Oregon in only a small portion of the far southwest corner of the state in the Siskiyou Mountains. It is similar in all ways to <em>A. caudatum</em>, but with striking silver markings on the leaves. I have never seen it available locally. If you’re interested in this something of a native collector’s item, visit <a href="http://www.hillkeep.ca" target="_blank">Pacific Rim Nursery’s website.</a></p>

							<p><strong>Family:</strong> Aristolochiaceae</p>
							<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Asarum caudatum</p>
							<p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Wild Ginger</p>
							<p><strong>Native Range:</strong> Commonly found in moist woodlands from the Cascades west to the Pacific Coast (A. caudatum), in the far southwest corner of Oregon, in the Siskiyou mountains (A. marmoratum)</p>
							<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Mostly evergreen, low growing groundcover, spreading by underground rhizomes; leaves are heart-shaped, dark green and leathery; flowers are thimble-shaped, maroon to brown in color, often nestled in amongst the foliage, with thin “tails” extending away from the blossom like rays.</p>
							<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Wild ginger grows natively in moist woodlands, with lots of acidic humus from the litter of fallen conifer needles. Supplying a similar condition will make your plant happy to settle in and spread by those thick rhizomes to eventually make a luxurious carpet in your woodland garden.</p>
							<p><strong>Light:</strong> Open to deep shade</p>
							<p><strong>Size:</strong> 6” tall, 12” wide</p>
							<p><strong>Pests/Diseases:</strong> Slugs can be a problem for A. caudatum in the garden.</p>
