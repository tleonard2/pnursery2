			<p>Typically a multi-stemmed large shrub with telltale maple leaves and elegant tiered branching, it is often found along waterways, gracefully reaching its branches out over the water, or in the fall providing a soft yellow glow in the dappled light beneath towering conifers.</p>
			<p>Flowers of wine-red and white form along the branches in the spring, contrasting with the red sheaths covering the yet-to-emerge leaves, giving a colorful show in the garden, especially along with the reddish new woody growth; soft green leaves follow. In the fall, <em>A. circinatum</em> can take on a variety of vibrant color, from soft yellow in shady spots to eye-popping orange/red when sited in more sun.</p>
			<p>Several variations of Acer circinatum have been discovered growing in Pacific Northwest forests and gardens and have been cultivated for their unique characteristics. See our article on the  <a href="/natives/acer/">species specific Acer.</a></p>

	                    <h2>FACTS: Acer circinatum</h2>
							<p><strong>Common name:</strong> Vine Maple</p>
							<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Symmetrically-lobed and toothed leaves, soft green sometimes tinged with red in spring, turning to yellow/orange/red in the fall. Dainty red and white flowers adorn bare branches in early spring. Grows as single or multi-stemmed large shrub/small tree; bark greenish to red, with tiered branching reminiscent of Japanese Maples. </p>
							<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Grows naturally as an understory tree in forests but is adaptable to a variety of settings.  Best in acidic soil rich in organic matter, with regular water and protection from afternoon sun. </p>
							<p><strong>Size:</strong> Whether single or multi-stemmed, A. circinatum rarely get taller than 20’, making it an especially useful plant for smaller, urban gardens, even suitable for large containers. Moderate growth – 1-2’ a year – means it achieves its mature size relatively quickly and can fill a niche in the woodland garden readily.</p>
							<p><strong>Pests and diseases:</strong> Mostly pest and disease free; however like other maples, it can become afflicted with Verticillium Wilt, but not commonly-so. Leaves will burn if exposed to full afternoon sun, with insufficient irrigation.</p>
