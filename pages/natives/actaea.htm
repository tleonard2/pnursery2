	    <h2>This is another one of those taxonomy shape-shifters — for years called <em>Cimicifuga</em>, it is now being included under the genus Actaea, so be advised to look for this plant by either name. By whichever name you find it, it is a lovely plant for the shade garden.</h2>

			<p>It is important to note however, that while not toxic to birds, the seeds (and possibly all parts of this plant) are highly toxic to mammals, including humans.</p>

			<p>Native only to British Columbia south through western Oregon, it is considered rare and endangered in the wild; not because it isn’t commonly found (which is the usual indicator, sizable communities but in only a few locations), but because the number of individual plants in the many places it can be found is very small, sometimes less than twenty-five in number. It has only been through careful propagation that they are now available for sale.</p>

			<p>Planting this woodland beauty in your garden, then, is an act of helping to restore and repopulate this important native plant. It is attractive as both a pollen and food source to more than one species of butterfly, and attracts bees and other beneficial insects.</p>

			<p>Its common name of Bugbane comes from both its attribute of being virtually pest-free, as well as useful as a bug-repellent.</p>

			<p>It is similar to <em>Actaea rubra</em> (Red Baneberry) and <em>Trautvetteria caroliniensis</em> (False Bugbane), but showier than both: lush mound of toothed, maple-like leaves is topped by wands of fragrant, delicately-frothy flower spikes of white to barely pink that can reach as tall as six feet.</p>

			<p>Blooming typically late June into August, they are magnets to bees, butterflies and other pollinators, and make a graceful presence in shady spots or woodland gardens. This plant requires little; give it humus-rich soil and ample water, and it will be happy.</p>

			<p>True to its name, Bugbane is virtually disease and pest free, and if left undisturbed, will self-seed and over time create a striking display in the latter part of the summer, when the spring flowers have long-since faded and disappeared.</p>

                <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Actaea / Cimicifuga</p>

                <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Bugbane</p>

                <p><strong>Native Range:</strong> Southern British Columbia through western Oregon, usually at low to medium elevation (uncommon).</p>

                <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Tall, graceful mound of foliage with toothed leaves similar to Japanese Maple. Flowering stems with bottlebrush clusters of small white to pinkish, fragrant flowers grow above foliage in mid-to late-summer, reaching up to 6’ in height. Flowers are followed by flat seed pods that are highly toxic to mammals, including humans.</p>

                <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Grows best in part sun / shade, humus-rich soil and regular water. Best sited in a dappled-sun, moist area of the garden.</p>
