	    			<h2>Of the fifteen or so Iris that are native to the whole of the west coast, seven are at home here in Oregon. Most grow in colorful drifts in primarily open wooded areas at low elevations west of the Cascades.</h2>

<p>The flowers, rising gracefully above the foliage on slender stems, wear colors ranging from deep bluish purple to lavender to yellow to white (or varying combinations of these), generally with dark purple veining.  Iris freely cross-pollinates in areas where two or more species grow adjacent to each other and naturally-occurring hybrids occur. </p>

<hr />

<p>Pacific Coast Iris Hybrids – In the wild many of the native Iris species growing in the same area will cross-pollinate and naturally hybridize. Some of these combinations result in beautiful color variations and combinations. Naturally-occurring hybrids can sometimes be found in nurseries, and are of unknown color until blooming. Named hybrids will be those intentionally created by hybridizers.</p>

						<p><strong>Family: </strong>Irisadacea </p>
          <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Iris</p>
          <p><strong>Common name: </strong>Iris</p>
          <p><strong>Native Range: </strong>several native species of Iris found throughout our region, both sides of the Cascades, at various elevations.</p>
          <p><strong>Characteristics: </strong>The native Iris has the classic grassy, strap-like leaves, with delicate flowers rising above, ranging in colors from white to yellow to purple to reddish, and combinations of one or more of these colors. Different species that grow together in the same habitat often cross-pollinate of their own accord as well, so there is a wide variation of color combinations within this palate!</p>
          <p><strong>Culture: </strong>Sun to partial shade, moisture levels vary depending on species and location. All prefer well-drained soil.</p>
          <p><strong>Pests/Diseases: </strong>Slugs are fond of the foliage of some native iris, but generally problem free. </p>
