	    <h2>Do you have a spot that gets no summer water? Is it in full sun or partial shade, with quick drainage, maybe even on a slope? Ceanothus could be the perfect answer to what is often a troublesome spot for gardeners!</h2>

	    <p>Our native wild lilacs range in form from groundcover to large shrub or small tree; deciduous and evergreen; flowers of creamy white to bright cobalt blue. What they all have in common, however, is their need for excellent drainage, lack of summer watering and nutritionally lean soil. Overwatering and overfeeding will shorten the lifespan of your Ceanothus considerably. In their native habitat, they reside in dry forests, dry rocky slopes, and dry wooded canyons.</p>
<p>This is the kind of setting you need to replicate in order to make Ceanothus happiest. But oh so worth the effort! Spring and summer, the slightly fragrant flowers are a magnet for hummingbirds, butterflies and especially bees. Evergreen varieties have the added benefit of providing seeds and cover for songbirds, too!</p>
<p>Here’s a sampling of the Oregon wild lilacs (disclaimer: not all of these are readily available).</p>

            <h3><em>Ceanothus cuneatus:</em> Buckbrush</h3>

                    <p>White or light blue flowers are kind of stinky (think daisies) in full bloom, but they’re worth it for attracting pollinators. Try planting it around the edges, away from outdoor dining areas. Small pretty evergreen gray–green leaves and spiny, branching habit.</p>
					<p>Grows 6-8’ x 6-8’, best in full sun, hardy Z7.</p>

            <h3><em>Ceanothus integerrimus</em>: Deer Brush</h3>

                    <p>Foamy white or blue flower clusters in the late spring/early summer. Deciduous green leaves. Grows in openings of mixed forests, west and east of the Cascades and in the Columbia Gorge. While it still needs well–drained soil, this one can tolerate a bit more water than some of the others. (Photo credit Franz Xaver).</p>
					<p>Grows 12’, full sun, hardy Z6.</p>

            <h3><em>Ceanothus prostratus:</em> Prostrate Ceanothus or Mahala Mat</h3>

                    <p>Flowers appear in late spring to mid–summer and are light to deep blue clusters about 1” across. Small, thick oval leaves are spiny along their edges, almost like miniature holly leaves. Bright red seed pods.</p>
<p>Grows to about 2" tall, forming mats as large as 6’ across, often rooting from branches that touch the ground. Sun, hardy Z5.</p>
<p>Note: while this is a lovely trailing shrub, it is a challenge to grow west of the Cascades</p>

                    <p>Fragrant white flowers in late spring-early summer. Deciduous shrub, with green leaves and striking purplish stems. Not as showy as some other varieties perhaps, but one that is more adaptable, as it is native to areas both east and west of the Cascades. (Photo Credit Walter Siegmund.</p>

                    <p>Grows 8-10’, sun-pt shade, Z6.</p>

            <h3><em>Ceanothus thyrsiflorus:</em> Blueblossom</h3>

                    <p>Easily the most popular native Ceanothus, recognized for seas of bright blue flowers that are typically humming with bees when blooming. Evergreen leaves are dark green on the upper surface, lighter green beneath.</p>
					<p>Grows natively from mid to southern Oregon and into northern California, west of the Cascades. This is a good choice for gardens providing that there is no irrigation in summer months.</p>
					<p>Grows 8-12’ x 8-12’, sun-pt shade, Z7.</p>

            <h3><em>Ceanothus velutinus:</em> Snowbrush, Mountain Balm</h3>

                    <p>Evergreen leaves carry a distinct resin–like fragrance that can be pleasant in the warmth of summertime, when planted near a patio or other outdoor seating area. The flowers too are fragrant, held in dense clusters of white during the summer. </p>
					<p>Grows up to 8’ x 8’, sun-pt shade, Z7.</p>

                <p><strong>Family:</strong> Rhamnaceae (Buckthorne)</p>
				<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Ceanothus</p>
				<p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Wild Lilac</p>
				<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Of the fifty or so species that are native to North America, there are a little over a half&ndash;dozen native to Oregon. (Many others are exclusively native to California, which is why the common name is often known as California Lilac.)</p>
				<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> There are evergreen and deciduous species of Ceanothus. Of the evergreen varieties, leaves tend to be small, rounded to oval, toothed and somewhat leathery in texture, usually dark green. Leaves of deciduous varieties are larger, softer in texture, rounded to oval and slightly toothed. Flowers of both types are generally showy, sometimes fragrant clusters or sprays of tiny flowers, ranging from creamy white to electrically–bright blue. </p>
				<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Grows in full sun to partial shade, with excellent drainage. Prefers lean soil conditions. Most are drought tolerant, to the point that they balk at summer water. These plants can be “killed with kindness” and too much water or fertilizer can result in a much shortened lifespan.</p>
				<p><strong>Pests &amp; Diseases:</strong> Ceanothus can attract aphids, mealybugs and scale, though they’re not thought to be particularly prone to these pests. Fungal diseases can occur if given too much water in summer or if not properly drained. They have a reputation of being somewhat short-lived, less than ten years - give them the right growing conditions for an optimal lifespan.</p>
