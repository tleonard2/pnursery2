<h2>I find symphoricarpos a fascinating and engaging species, whether native or not. </h2>

<p>Spend any time in the woods on either side of the Cascades, and you will probably encounter our native Snowberry, Symphoricarpos albus. It’s also becoming a familiar sight in many urban parks and natural areas, as it is an easy-going, carefree native shrub.</p>
<p>In spring it is fairly unassuming with its small, round-to-oval green leaves and sometimes rather twiggy stature. But it catches more attention when it flowers: Though the blossoms are tiny (less than a half-inch) pinkish-white tubes, they are abundant enough during their long bloom period of late spring to late summer to catch the eye of passers-by and hummingbirds alike. But it is in autumn when the plant’s namesake is realized: the stems are covered with stark white berries that persist after leaf drop and make for an especially interesting and attractive shrub in the winter garden.</p>
<p>Birds are attracted to the berries, but it is also true that the Snowberry’s fruit is not their first favorite choice -- so that means the shrub can be an attractive feature in the garden through the winter and also then available food for birds in the leaner times of late winter.</p>

<h3><em>Symphoricarpos albus:</em> Common Snowberry</h3>

<p>Snowberry can grow in sun or part shade, in moist, dry, even poor soils. Planted on a slope, it can help prevent erosion, spreading by thick underground rhizomes. Grows 2-4’ x 2-4’.</p>

<h3><em>Symphoricarpos mollis var. hesperius:</em> Creeping Snowberry</h3>

<p>There are also native creeping snowberries; the main one west of the Cascades is <em>S. mollis var. hesperius</em> — often used synonymously with <em>S. mollis.</em> Grows 1-2’ tall x 2-5’ wide – Sun to shade but may be more drought tolerant in shadier areas.</p>

<h3><em>Symphoricarpos occidentalis:</em> Western Snowberry</h3>

<p>East of the Cascades <em>S. occidentalis</em> (Western Snowberry or Wolfberry) and <em>S. oreophilus</em> (Mountain Snowberry) are more common.</p>

<p><em>Be aware that there is a minor toxicity to humans associated with Symphoricarpos berries —not at all considered dangerous or deadly, but can cause degrees of stomach upset, so not for snacking by humans.</em></p>
