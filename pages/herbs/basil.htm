	    <h2>Basil is perhaps the quintessential herb of summer.  An essential herb in pasta sauce, pesto, caprese salad, stir fry; basil is used in many culinary dishes across the globe.  It is a plant soaked in history and lore.  </h2>
	                    <p>Greeks and Romans believed one should curse when sowing the seed to ensure germination.  Basil found its way to Western Europe via the spice traders in the 16th century.  Since this time Mediterranean food has been infused with basil.  In India, Holy basil, or Tulsi, is considered sacred, a goddess.  It has also been said basil helps keep away flying insects.  It is great to plant it near your tomatoes (rumors that it helps improve their flavor).</p>
     <p>Basils contain a variety of volatile oils that fluctuate according to variety and growing conditions.  Sweet basil varieties have mostly anise and orange blossom scents with little camphor.  European varieties add a little spice with cinnamon aromas.  Asian varieties are high in clove whereas African varieties are rich in camphor and anise.</p>
      <p>Besides a prolific use in the culinary realm, basil has also been used in a tea to aid digestion, help with a cold or flu, migraines, insomnia and bug bites.   Since it is in the mint family, the flowers help attract beneficial insects.  Several varieties are very attractive and make lovely additions to the floral border. </p>

	                    <h2>Basil</h2>
						<p><strong>Family:</strong>  Lamiaceae</p>
						<p><strong>Genus:</strong>  Ocimum</p>
						<p><strong>Common Name:</strong>  Basil</p>
						<p><strong>Origin:</strong> About 150 annual, perennial and shrubby species from the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa and India.</p>
						<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Basil requires full sun, fertile, well-drained soil, regular water, and warm temperatures to thrive.  Basil will rot easily under cool wet conditions.  Seedlings are prone to a deadly fungal disease, damping off, caused by overcrowding and overly wet conditions.  It is best to plant Basil outdoors in the ground when night temperatures are above 50 degrees.
						To grow Basil indoors, plant in any good potting soil and fertilize monthly with a liquid fertilizer that has been diluted by half.  Place in an area that receives at least six hours of direct sun or consider supplemental light.  Keep the soil moist, allowing to dry between waterings.  Yellowing leaves can be a sign of overwatering.</p>
						<p><strong>Harvest:</strong>  There are a couple ways to harvest Basil.  One is to pick leaves as you need them, usually best from the top to encourage new growth.  More commonly cut the stems just above a set of leaves.  Pinch of any flower buds to maintain peak leaf production.  The flavor can change after flowering.   The flowers are also edible, and lovely as a garnish.  To dry Basil, pluck the leaves from the stems and place in a paper bag in a warm area.  Shake the bag every day to create air flow. The leaves should dry in 5-7 days.</p>
						<p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong>  Botrytis, Downy Mildew, damping off, whiteflies.</p>
						<p>Basil Downy Mildew (BDM) is relatively new to the Pacific Northwest.  It was first reported in Florida in 2006, and has been moving into many states since then.  Initial symptoms are subtle, yellowing leaves that fall off.  It can easily be confused with burn or a nutrient deficiency.  </p>
						<p>Next, irregular black spots develop on the infected leaves and a whitish grey fuzzy develops on the underside of the spotted leaves.  This fuzz is the spores of the fungus which can travel quite a distance on the wind to effect neighboring Basil plants.  </p>
								<p>Once you have confirmed infections of BDM, remove the plants by covering them with plastic bags (as to not spread the spores more) and throw them in the trash (the spores can live in compost piles). It is said the spores can live up to eight years in the soil.   </p>
									<p>Replant Basil in a completely new location.  There are not any varieties resistant to BDM.  Keeping Basil leaves dry, and using preventative organic fungicides, such as neem oil, can help reduce the possibility of infection.</p>
