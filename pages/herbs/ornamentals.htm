<h2>Ornamental cabbages and kales add wonderful texture and color to winter containers and garden borders.  They offer a cooler color pallet in shades of purple, pink, green and white.</h2>

<p>Textures vary from smooth ruffled rosettes to intensely curled heads.  Generally the cabbage cultivars have smooth scalloped leaves and stay lower to the ground.  In comparison, kale varieties can be more feathery, sometimes taller, and may hold their color better.  Like edible cabbages and kales, ornamental varieties slow down or almost stop growing above ground generally in October.  If planted in time, most varieties hold at 12-18&rdquo; tall and wide through the winter.</p>

<p>With the onset of warm weather the spires of yellow flowers can shoot up to three feet tall.  Since they thrive in cold weather they are the perfect accent to pansies, dusty miller, conifers, evergreen grasses and perennials.  Also some tall varieties are popular in the floral industry for bouquets and arrangements.</p>

<p>Leaves and flowers of ornamental cabbages and kales are also edible!  They are the same species as varieties commonly know as edible.  Restaurants have been using the attractive leaves for garnish for years, but they are also tasty in salad, stir-fry and as kale chips.</p>
<p>It is important to inquire at your local nursery whether the plants are safe to eat, or may have residual pesticides that are not intended for consumption.  Brassica flowers are also an excellent source of early pollen and nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Facts: Ornamentals</h2>

<p><strong>Family:</strong> Brassicaceae</p>

<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Brassica oleracea Acephala Group= kale (no head), Capitata Group= cabbage (heads)</p>

<p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Ornamental cabbage and kale</p>

<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Western Europe</p>

<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Cool weather biennials that intensify in color with temperatures below 40°F.  They require full to part, consistently moist well drained soil.  These plants persist through the winter in the Portland area and bolt (elongate and go to flower) when temperatures warm up in late winter early spring.  Once plants flower they will begin to decline and die.  Some gardeners love the flowers while others do not.  Removing flower stalks as they begin to elongate can prolong the ornamental life some what.  Cabbages and kales can be buried by snow and survive occasional dips to 15-20°F</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Since ornamental cabbages and kales are grown in the cooler season very little maintenance is required other than regular water if they are not exposed to rain.</p>

<p><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> Unfortunately this group of plants is an aphid magnet.  If plants are kept in a very sheltered area through the winter, aphids may appear in the winter months.  Otherwise they will most likely arrive during the first warm weather spell.  Aphids can be controlled with insecticidal soap, pyrethrins or neem oil.</p>

<p><strong>Propagation: </strong>Ornamental cabbages and kales are generally propagated by seed sown in July.</p>
