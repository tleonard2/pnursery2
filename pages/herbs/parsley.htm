                    <p>Nature’s vitamin!  Parsley is packed with Iron, vitamins C and A.  The high chlorophyll content of the leaves can freshen your breath.  A sprig has also been said to aid digestion.  A great ingredient in smoothies.  An essential herb for flavoring soups, sauces and many other dishes (parsley pesto anyone?).</p>
                    <p>Parsley is a key ingredient in many Middle Eastern dishes such as tabbouleh, and continues to be a popular garnish.  Not only is it attractive on a plate, but it adds great texture and vibrant green to containers and gardens.  Try a border of curly parsley and marigolds for something a little different.</p>
	<p>Parsley is easy to grow and adaptable to many growing conditions.  It is a biennial in our climate, which means it will last 1 ½ years.  However if planted in fall it usually bolts (goes to flower) in the spring.  The white lacy flowers attract beneficial insects and swallowtail butterflies!  Parsley often reseeds in the garden so it is easy to get it naturalized.  The seeds also make a tasty seasoning.</p>
