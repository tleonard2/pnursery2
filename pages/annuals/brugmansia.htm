                <h2>Both <em>Brugmansia</em> and <em>Datura</em> are exceptionally beautiful in containers and in the garden. Not only are they stunning, but also fragrant too!</h2>

                <h3>Brugmansia</h3>

                <p><em>Brugmansia</em> are annual trees or shrubs (in our climate) with pendulous, not erect, flowers reaching 6-10' in a single season. Ranging in height from 6-30', most have tan, slightly rough bark and produce spiny fruit. The leaves are generally large and alternate, some with toothy margins and covered with fine hairs. Their common name refers to the large, very dramatic trumpet-shaped flowers. These may be single or double, growing 8-20" in length and up to 12" across. Color ranges from white through yellow to pink and even orange or red. Flowers are fragrant with citrus overtones, most noticeable in early evening.</p>

                <p>Almost all varieties of <em>Brugmansia</em> and <em>Datura</em> are spectacular specimen plants ideally suited for the garden spotlight. Angel trumpets are awe inspiring as the centerpiece in containers. They can also be used to create dramatic backdrops in mixed borders that say, "WOW!" As they are most fragrant at night, and most have white or very light colored blooms, they are also ideally suited for moon gardens. The tree-like <em>Brugmansia</em> provides a living trellis for annual vines such as Heavenly Blue Morning glory. Lantana couples beautifully with both <em>Datura</em> and <em>Brugmansia</em> as well.</p>

                <h2>Datura: Jimson Weed, Angel’s Trumpet, Thorn Apple</h2>

                <p><em>Datura</em> is a genus of nine commonly recognized species. Its precise and natural distribution is uncertain due to its extensive cultivation and naturalization throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the globe. Within the Americas its distribution is mostly restricted to the U.S. and Mexico, where the highest species diversity occurs.</p>

                <p><em>Daturas</em> are herbaceous, leafy annuals or short-lived perennials which can grow up to 6' in height. Leaves are alternate, velvety textured, with a lobed or toothy margin. Flowers are erect or spreading, trumpet-shaped, and 2-8" long by 2-4" wide. Most are moderately to highly fragrant especially at night. Flower color varies from white to yellow, pink, and rich purple. They may be single to fully double in form. The fruit is a spiny capsule giving rise to its other common names of thorn apple and devil's apple. When ripe they split open releasing many seeds.</p>

                <h4>Note that ALL parts of ALL members of both genera are highly toxic and may be fatal if ingested by humans, pets, or livestock.</h4>

                        <h2>BRUGMANSIA &amp; DATURA</h2>
						<h3>Note that ALL parts of ALL members of both genera are highly toxic and may be fatal if ingested by humans, pets, or livestock.</h3>
                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Solanaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Brugmansia, Datura</p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Both <em>Brugmansia</em> and <em>Datura</em> are commonly called angel trumpets.</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to subtropical regions of South America, along the Andes from Colombia to northern Chile, and also in southern Brazil.</p>

                        <p><strong>Height:</strong> <em>Brugmansia</em> range in height from 6-30;' Datura range up to 2-6' in height.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> <em>Brugmansia</em> are easily grown in moist, fertile, well-drained soil, in full sun to part shade, in frost-free climates (They are considered annuals in our climate). In our climate, outdoor plants need protection. Potted plants can be moved into a greenhouse.</p>

                        <p>Plants in the ground can be heavily pruned to induce dormancy, dug up, and overwintered in a cool, dark place.</p>

                        <p><em>Datura</em> are easily grown in part to full sun, in moist, well-drained soil. Outdoors in good locations the plants tend to reseed readily and may become invasive.</p>

                        <p>Both genera need good drainage and plenty of water. Infrequent, deep watering is preferable to constant, shallow watering.</p>

                        <p><strong>Propagation &amp; Overwintering:</strong> Most species of <em>Brugmansia</em> are easily propagated from cuttings taken from the end of a branch in summer. <em>Brugmansia</em> can be overwintered indoors in cool a cool dark place such as a basement.</p>

                        <p><em>Datura</em> are usually grown each year from seed or starts, though with care plants may be overwintered.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> <em>Brugmansia</em> are thirsty plants that will require frequent fertilizer application to promote continuous bloom. During the main growing season they should be fed with a bloom-boosting, water soluble fertilizer according to the package directions. In the ground they will likely need weekly, deep watering. In pots the frequency will likely increase to several times per week, or whenever the top 2-4" of soil is dry. Plants may be pruned for shaping or to control size. Frequent deadheading will promote continued bloom. <em>Datura</em> are drought tolerant, and do not require heavy fertilizing. </p>

                        <p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong> Both genera are commonly bothered by whiteflies, spider mites, and aphids. Occasionally cabbage worms, cucumber beetles, slugs, snails, mealy bugs, and fungus gnats may become a problem. Treat with appropriate insecticides, slug bait, or repellent products. Overwatering can lead to root rot and other fungal infections. Possible diseases include tobacco mosaic virus, tomato spotted wilt, fusarium wilt, verticillium wilt, Phytophthora, Phoma, and Botrytis.</p>

                        <p><strong>Garden Uses:</strong> Almost all varieties are spectacular specimen plants ideally suited for the garden spotlight. Angel trumpets are awe inspiring as the centerpiece in containers. They can also be used to create dramatic backdrops in mixed borders that say, "WOW!" As they are most fragrant at night, and most have white or very light colored blooms, they are also ideally suited for moon gardens. Planted in tall pots or overhanging banks they form an intoxicating bower for evening garden parties or romantic dinners.</p>
