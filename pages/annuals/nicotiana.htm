	    <h2>An old-fashioned cottage garden favorite, Nicotianas are carefree plants that will provide color and fragrance all summer long.</h2>

 <p>Also known as flowering tobacco, the genus Nicotiana consists of more than 60 species, including the plant notorious for producing smoking tobacco. Nicotianas are named after Jean Nicot, a 16th century Ambassador who is credited with introducing tobacco to the French court, where it gained popularity in the form of medicinal snuff. Ornamental Nicotianas aren't grown for this usage, but for their uniquely beautiful flowers, wonderful fragrance, and graceful appearance in the garden. They are also deer-resistant, and are highly attractive to hummingbirds and butterflies! The trumpet-like, star- or bell-shaped flowers bloom throughout the season and come in a range of colors and bi-colors, from pure white to shades of pink, red and purple, and even true green.</p>

                    <p><strong>Nicotiana alata</strong></p>

                    <p>Many Nicotianas are fairly tall plants&mdash;some topping out at over 8 feet&mdash;but their open habit fits nicely in the middle of a mixed border. They also do well in containers, as long as ample space is provided. Some modern hybrids have been bred for very short, compact growth, and can be tucked in anywhere a spot of color is required. Many varieties are highly fragrant, though generally at night, so plant near a window or patio where the sweet scent can be most enjoyed.</p>

                    <p>Nicotianas are easy to grow, but do best in rich soil in full sun. Amending with organic matter will help improve soil. Although relatively drought-tolerant, Nicotianas do appreciate regular watering, and a few applications of an organic flower fertilizer will keep plants in bloom all season. Most Nicotiana species are true perennials in their native climates, but rarely overwinter in Pacific Northwest gardens. However, they are very easy to start from seed.</p>

                    <p>Please note that all parts of Nicotiana plants are toxic if ingested, so keep away from nibbling pets or children.</p>

	             <h3>Facts: nicotiana</h3>

                <p><strong>Family:</strong> Tropaeolaceae</p>

                <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Tropaeolum</p>

                <p><strong>Common name:</strong> nicotiana</p>

                <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Central and South America</p>

                <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Very easy to grow. nicotianas prefer leaner soils. Using fertilizers on nicotianas tends to make plants put out lots of leaves and few blossoms. They prefer full sun, but can do well in part sun or dappled shade situations. nicotianas look their best during cooler weather in the summer.</p>

                <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> The tall or climbing varieties sometimes benefit from slight pruning. Removing yellow leaves keeps them looking fresh. Deadheading is not necessary. Average watering needs; water more frequently when the weather is hot.</p>

                <p><strong>Pests &amp; Diseases:</strong> Prone to aphids, usually late in the season. nicotianas are sometimes used as a trap crop to lure aphids away from more susceptible plants. Look for aphids on the undersides of leaves, and remove and destroy affected leaves, or use a strong jet of water from the hose to knock pests off.</p>

                <p>Insecticidal soaps and horticultural oils can be applied, but nicotianas are very resilient, so it's not usually necessary. Slugs and caterpillars sometimes dine on young plants early in the season.</p>

                <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Very easy to start from seed. The seeds are large and easily handled, making them ideal for children's gardens. Start seeds indoors 2-4 weeks before the last frost date. Be careful not to start too early, as nicotianas are very susceptible to cold damage.</p>

                <p>It's better to sow seeds directly in the garden in April or May, until as late as July. nicotiana seeds germinate and grow rapidly in warm soils. Young plants are also available to purchase in summer. Take care in transplanting; nicotianas resent having their roots disturbed. nicotianas tend to reseed.</p>
