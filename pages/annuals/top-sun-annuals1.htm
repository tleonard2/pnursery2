				<h4><em>Amaranth</em> ‘Illumination’- Thriller</h4>
				<p>The colorful punch from this sun loving annual comes from the foliage rather than flowers.  It is a bit cold sensitive in early spring so we generally don’t have them for sale until late May.  Then wow they grow fast reaching 3-5’ tall!  They are also easily grown from seed, best started indoors, under lights in mid-late April.</p>

 <h4><em>Calibrichoa,</em> (Millionbells) -<br>
                        Spiller</h4>

                        <p>Calibrichoas have replaced Petunias in popularity for hanging baskets. They require far less fertilizer while offering a wider range of colors. There is a varied range of growing habits from the large &quot;Superbells&quot; series, mounding &quot;Callie&quot;series and the low &quot;Trailing&quot; series. Flower styles can be single or double, solid colors or with a contrasting eye. They combine superbly with sweet potato vine, bacopa and much more.</p>

                        <p>We love annuals that plant themselves for next year! Cosmos are very easy to grow and are great cut flowers too! They bloom early summer to frost. In the fall they always drop seeds that will come up the following spring. Watch for feathery seedlings where your Cosmos once grew. (<em>Cosmos</em> 'Sonata Carmine' pictured)</p>

				 <h4><em>Cuphea</em> 'Samba' - Filler</h4>

                        <p>This is a fantastic filler that flowers all summer with minimal fertilizing. The red bat-faced flowers have a wonderful contrasting throat and attract hummingbirds. It thrives in full to part sun and reaches 10-12&quot; tall. Combines great with Purple Fountain Grass, Bidens and Sweet Potato Vine.</p>

				 <h4><em>Digiplexis</em> ‘Illumination Flame’- Thriller</h4>

                        <p>My what a beauty!  A recent cross between our familiar foxglove and its Canary Island cousin.  Brilliant spires of salmon and apricot flowers reach 3-5’ in a single season.  Blooms non-stop May-frost.  It may even overwinter in a mild season.  Combines well with just about anyting too!  Available at the nursery April-July. </p>

                        Thriller</h4>

                        <p>This annual offers an elegant focal point to any design. Spikes of long, pendant white flowers are fragrant on warm evenings. This Nicotiana reaches 5' tall and 2-3' wide. It thrives in full to part sun with minimal to average water. Sometimes this Nicotiana will come back for another year of beauty, or it may reseed.</p>

                        <p>This new petunia is a rich black that has a luminous sheen giving it the appearance of velvet. Its siblings 'Phantom' and 'Pinstripe' have various presentations of black and white. 'Black Velvet' is very fun in hanging baskets when combined with a contrasting bright color like chartreuse or red.</p>

  <h4><em>Ricinus</em> 'Carmencita Red'<br>
                        (Castor Bean) - Thriller</h4>

                        <p>Bold, big burgundy leaves is what makes this annual so fantastic. Later in the summer clusters of red, prickly seed pods offer an added interest. Castor Beans love heat and sun and therefore do not appear in nurseries until June. They quickly reach 4-6' tall and dominate most plantings. Once you have a castor bean it is likely to spread its seeds in a non-invasive manner. <em>It is important to note that all parts of the Castor Bean plant are poisonous.</em> Castor beans combine well with Cannas, Angel's Trumpet and grasses.</p>

    <h4><em>Zinnia</em> 'Profusion' series - Filler</h4>

                        <p>These darling, small flowered Zinnas really pack a punch with non-stop flower production. They come in a wide color range from white to orange and bloom June to frost. Growing 12&quot; tall and wide they make great fillers in containers and edging for beds. They are low maintenance, self-cleaning and mildew-resistant. Zinnias are best planted in full sun after all danger of frost has passed.</p>
