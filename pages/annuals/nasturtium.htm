	    <h2>Beautiful, easy to grow, and delicious, no garden should be without Nasturtiums! Nasturtiums have been a garden favorite for generations, and rightly so. With boldly-colored, exotic-looking flowers that float above elegant lily pad-shaped leaves.</h2>

                   <p>Nasturtiums are carefree plants that bloom all summer long without asking much of anything from the gardener.</p>

                    <p>That's right: no deadheading and no fertilizing. They also attract butterflies and hummingbirds, and are said to repel less-desirable insects, deer, and rabbits. The greatest charm of Nasturtiums may, however, be their culinary usage. All parts of the plant are edible, and have a spicy, peppery tang. Fresh leaves and flowers are a zesty addition to salads or sandwiches, or can be stuffed and saut&eacute;ed, or made into pesto.</p>

                    <p>Unripe Nasturtium seed pods can even be pickled to make an excellent substitute for capers. The flavor of nasturtium is reminiscent of watercress, and there is sometimes confusion between the two plants: the botanical name for watercress is Nasturtium officinale, even though it is a member of the mustard family and not related to the flower known as Nasturtium.</p>

                    <p>At home in the ground or in containers, the growth habit of Nasturtiums is usually described as either &quot;mounding&quot; or &quot;trailing&quot;. Mounding Nasturtiums form a neat, round bundle, usually about 10 to 12&quot; wide and slightly less tall. Trailing, or vining, varieties can climb 5' or more if given a trellis, or can be allowed to sprawl and ramble on the ground. They also look good as the spiller accent in pots. Whether you have a veggie garden or a formal border, leave some room for a few Nasturtiums!</p>

	               <h2>Facts: Nasturtium</h2>

                <p><strong>Family:</strong> Tropaeolaceae</p>

                <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Tropaeolum</p>

                <p><strong>Common name:</strong> Nasturtium</p>

                <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Central and South America</p>

                <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Very easy to grow. Nasturtiums prefer leaner soils. Using fertilizers on Nasturtiums tends to make plants put out lots of leaves and few blossoms. They prefer full sun, but can do well in part sun or dappled shade situations. Nasturtiums look their best during cooler weather in the summer.</p>

                <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> The tall or climbing varieties sometimes benefit from slight pruning. Removing yellow leaves keeps them looking fresh. Deadheading is not necessary. Average watering needs; water more frequently when the weather is hot.</p>

                <p><strong>Pests &amp; Diseases:</strong> Prone to aphids, usually late in the season. Nasturtiums are sometimes used as a trap crop to lure aphids away from more susceptible plants. Look for aphids on the undersides of leaves, and remove and destroy affected leaves, or use a strong jet of water from the hose to knock pests off.</p>

                <p>Insecticidal soaps and horticultural oils can be applied, but Nasturtiums are very resilient, so it's not usually necessary. Slugs and caterpillars sometimes dine on young plants early in the season.</p>

                <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Very easy to start from seed. The seeds are large and easily handled, making them ideal for children's gardens. Start seeds indoors 2-4 weeks before the last frost date. Be careful not to start too early, as Nasturtiums are very susceptible to cold damage.</p>

                <p>It's better to sow seeds directly in the garden in April or May, until as late as July. Nasturtium seeds germinate and grow rapidly in warm soils. Young plants are also available to purchase in summer. Take care in transplanting; Nasturtiums resent having their roots disturbed. Nasturtiums tend to reseed.</p>
