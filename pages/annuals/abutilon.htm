                    <p>Along with all this beautiful color its flowers also attract hummingbirds and other beneficial insects to your garden. There are some varieties that are more cold hardy. The benefit of over wintering your Abutilon is that you get a bigger more vigorous plant the following year.</p>

                    <p>Some varieties you can find at Portland Nursery include:</p>

	                    <h3>FACTS: Abutilon</h3>

                <p><strong>Family:</strong> Malvaceae</p>

                <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Abutilon</p>

                <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Flowering Maple, Chinese Lantern (not to be confused with Physalis), and Indian Mallow</p>

                <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Species come from South or Central America, Australia, and Africa.</p>

                <p><strong>Culture:</strong> This genus enjoys having light shade to full sun. Its bell shaped flowers range in color from white through pink, and from yellow to orange all the way to a deep bronzy red. Its leaves are palmate like a maple hence the common name 'Flowering Maple'. In our climate it is mostly grown as an annual but it is possible to over winter them in a protected spot like a porch or by bringing them inside during the colder months.</p>

                <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Give plenty of water especially on the hottest summer days. Provide good drainage. Fertilizing once a week, during the growing season, will extend the blooms. Plants can be pruned to desired shape and even cut back hard in early spring to control size.</p>

                <p><strong>Pests &amp; Diseases:</strong> Aphids and slugs can be a challenge for these plants outdoors. When brought indoors they can be susceptible to houseplant pests such as whiteflies, spider mites, scale, and mealybugs. These can be treated with insecticides. Common diseases include root rot, rust, Alternaria and Cercospora leaf spot. These can be controlled by providing good air circulation, keeping the leaves dry and if necessary using a fungicide.</p>
