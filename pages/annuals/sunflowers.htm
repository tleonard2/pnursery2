                    <h2>Edible seeded varieties</h2>

                    <p>Edible seeded varieties have large tasty seeds great for snacking. Varieties generally have large, single stemmed flowers, grow very tall and are the classic golden yellow.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Giganteus</strong> - This huge single flowered type produces golden yellow heads a foot or more across. You don’t need to stake this one – the extra strong stocks are massive with huge leaves that can withstand high winds. Grows 12-14&rsquo; tall!</li>

                        <li><strong>Mongolian Giant</strong> - Big, sunny yellow flowers with huge edible seeds that you can harvest for your own delicious, healthy, nutty snacks. When the green disc on the back of the 7-8&quot; blooms begins to turn yellow, cut the heads off and leave to mature in a dry, well-ventilated place. After the disc turns dark brown, rub with your hands to remove the seeds. To roast, spread in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast for about 10 minutes in a 350&deg; oven. When seeds start to swell and the hulls crack, they’re ready – just cool and salt to taste. Plants grow 4&rsquo; tall.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>How to harvest seeds:</strong> Cut flower heads when green bracts on the back of the flower begin to shrivel. Allow to dry in heads in a dry, well-ventilated area.</p>

	            <h2>Starting Sunflowers</h2>

	             <p>Did you know sunflowers exhibit a characteristic called heliotropism? This means the flowers will move to face the sun through the course of a day. There are a few perennial types: <strong><em>Helianthus angustifolius</em> &lsquo;Gold Lace&rsquo;, <em>Helianthus</em> &lsquo;Flore Pleno&rsquo; and <em>Helianthus</em> &lsquo;Lemon Queen&rsquo;.</strong> These varieties come back every year reaching lofty heights of 6-7&rsquo; tall with masses of 2-4&rdquo; yellow flowers.</p>

                    <p>As the name might imply, sunflowers require full sun (at least 8 hours), fertile soil and deep infrequent water to thrive. If you allow your sunflowers to drop seeds where they grew, you are likely to get volunteers the following season!</p>

	            <p><strong>Starting from seed:</strong> You can get a jump start on your sunflowers by starting them indoors, in 4&rdquo; pots, under lights 2-3 weeks before planting outdoors (generally early April). Seeds can be directly planted mid to late April through May. Birds, cutworms or slugs may eat new seedlings so take precautions to protect them, or plant some extra seed. Thin seedlings 4-24&rdquo; apart depending on the eventual size of the variety. If continuous bouquet harvest is your goal, we recommend planting seeds every 10-14 days, or selecting varieties with different maturity dates.</p>

                    <p><strong>Starting with plants:</strong> We have a large selection of sunflower starts beginning in early May. Below are some highlights. Please call for current availability.</p>
