                               <h3>Tender Succulent FAQs</h3>

                <h4>Do succulents need a special soil?</h4>

                <p>Yes. Succulents need a fast draining soil. Use a cactus mix or add some sand to potting soil.</p>

                <h4>How can I save my plants for next year?</h4>

                <p>Bring your tender succulents indoors in mid to late October. Position them in a south or west facing window or under a grow light for the winter. Bring them outdoors again in late May. Transition the plants from indoors to outdoors by putting them out for the day and in at night for a week.</p>

                <p>You can also take cuttings of your tender succulents to make more for next year and share with friends. Each kind is propagated a little differently, but most are quite easy.</p>

                <h4>How often should I water my succulents?</h4>

                <p>Allow succulent plantings to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering and poorly drained soil are the biggest challenges with succulents.</p>
