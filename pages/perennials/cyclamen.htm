<h2>Hardy Cyclamen Species</h2>
<p>Incredibly unique&nbsp;flowers with reflexed petals is just one of the charms&nbsp;of cyclamen. &nbsp;Hardy&nbsp;<em>varietes are</em>&nbsp;and enchanting ground cover that can thirve under some of the most difficult growing conditions. &nbsp;They can carpet an area of dry shade under Rhododendrons. &nbsp;Cyclamen are especially cheery with Hellebores and sweet box (<em>Saracocca</em>). &nbsp;Since many species&nbsp;originate from the Mediterrean and Middle East, they go summer dormant. &nbsp;With this in mind it is important to plant them in areas that do not recieve a lot of summer water and heavily acidic soils. &nbsp;An established Daphne would be another good companion for hardy cyclamen. &nbsp;Once established, hardy cyclamen will reseed. &nbsp;Sometimes seeds are spread by birds that favor their sweet coating. &nbsp;All species require very little maintenance.</p>

<h2><a id="florist" name="florist"></a>Florist Cyclamen</h2>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest Florist's cyclamen<em>, Cyclamen persicum,</em>&nbsp;are considered annuals or houseplants because they do not tolerate temperatures below 25&ordm;F for extended periods of time. They can succefully grow on a protected porch to provide blooms all winter.</p>

<p>Florist's cyclamen, with its large flowers and long bloom season brings a special brightness and texture to fall, winter, and spring containers. Other winter flowers cover a range of subdued colors, but these flowers are big and bright and remind us that another season is always just around the corner. Plus many varieties are fragrant too! Not only do they have charming flowers, but they also have beautiful heart-shaped leaves with unique silver markings. Florist's cyclamen make the perfect gift for the winter season.</p>

<h2>Facts: Cyclamen</h2>
<p><strong>Family:</strong>&nbsp;Primulaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus: </strong>Cyclamen</p>
<p><strong>Common name:</strong>&nbsp;Persian violets</p>
<p><strong>Origin: </strong>23 species from Central Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. Native habitat ranges from alpine meadows, deciduous woodland, and areas of rock and scrub</p>
<p><strong>Culture: </strong>Good drainage is essential; note that all the above microclimates are likely to have freely draining or rocky soil. Florist's cyclamen prefers bright indirect light, while <strong><em>C. hederifolium and C. coum</em></strong> can be planted in full sun or light shade since they will be dormant during portion of the year when hot sun might burn them.</p>
<p>In the ground, cyclamen need no supplemental water. Container grown, the soil must neither dry out completely nor be soggy. Use a freely draining potting mix, plant the tuber with its crown just above the soil surface, then add 1-2 inches of gravel or grit on top.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Varies some by species. For the two hardy species, <strong><em>C. hederifolium and C. coum</em></strong>, very little maintenance is required. Clear up spent leaves and flowers at the onset of hot weather if desired, and ensure the area receives as little supplemental water as possible (none is best) until the first fall rains bring about active growth.</p>
<p>For florist's cyclamen (which has been bred from <strong><em>C. persicum</em></strong>), some special care is required. It can neither tolerate freezing nor having the soil constantly wet, so it must be kept in a protected, covered location.</p>
<p>During cold snaps, more protection such as bringing it inside may be necessary, but one must also keep in mind that prolonged temperatures of 68 degrees or warmer will force it into "summer" dormancy. Therefore, a garage or basement may be the best protection during cold snaps. Water containerized cyclamen by setting its pot in 2-3" of water for about 30 seconds, and do so only when dry at least an inch down from the top.</p>
<p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong> To say the slugs like the leaves may be going too far, but in winter, a slug will eat any leaf it can find. Since cyclamen generally prefer places with some protection from winter rain, slug bait should be a viable control option.</p>
<p>Botrytis (grey mold) prefers many of the same conditions as cyclamen, and can be an especially bad problem for container grown cyclamen. Treatments include strong fungicides and are not always effective, so prevention is of the utmost importance. Keys to prevention include: not overwatering and never pouring water onto the crown, planting containers with the top of the tuber above the soil and then covering with an inch of grit, cleaning up spent flowers promptly, encouraging good airflow (especially at night,) and avoiding excess nitrogen in the fertilizer.</p>
