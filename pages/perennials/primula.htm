   <p>Primroses have been a vibrant addition to the spring,  woodland garden and containers for over a century. The name <em>Primula</em> is derived from the Italian word  for spring <em>primavera</em>. An explosion of  color in every shade of the rainbow, primroses primarily prefer cooler  temperatures and therefore bloom early spring through May. </p>
	  <p>Primroses combine  fabulously with spring bulbs, evergreen grasses and dusty miller. Some species  such as <strong><em>P. marginata</em> </strong>are more  diminutive and perfect for rock gardens or trough containers. Other species  such as <strong><em>P. japonica</em> and <em>P. veris</em> </strong>reseed and create naturalized  drifts in the shade garden. </p>
	  <p>The many types of primroses are divided into three basic  categories. Candelabra types (i.e. <span class="style1"><em>P. capita</em> and <em>P. japonica</em></span>) show off their  flowers in tiered clusters of 6-8 blooms on 1-2 &frac12; &lsquo; stems. They are often short lived, prefer damp soil  and reseed. </p>
	  <p>Polyanthus types (i.e.<em> <strong>P.  vulgaris</strong></em><strong> and <em>P. veris</em></strong>) bear  bunches of flowers on 6-8&rdquo; stems and bloom winter and/or early spring. This  group includes the common primroses sold as color spots. </p>
	  <p>The third group is  evergreen and heralds from mountainous areas. This includes <strong><em>P. auricula</em></strong> which has small clusters of  flat topped flowers in a unique range of color. They also have distinctive  thick leaves with a powdery coating on the underside. These types are often  grown in pots since they need sharp drainage and lime.</p>
	  <p>Here at Portland Nursery we will be carrying a wide range of  Primroses this spring. We will have a rainbow of colors and types. Drop in to  see what is new and blooming!	  </p>

Lately there has been more  development with double types such as the Rosanna and Doublet series. Also, the  &lsquo;Wanda&rsquo; series has a darker leaf and the flowers are in rich jewel tones. Most  of the English primroses are treated as annuals, and bloom until the weather  gets hot. They can be perennial if given good drainage and regular fertilizer  around bloom time.</p>
