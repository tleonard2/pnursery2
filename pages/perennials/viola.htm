                    <p>This well-known and much-loved genus includes over 500 species of annuals and perennials found in all the temperate regions of the world.

                    <p>Annual pansies and violas are invaluable for winter and spring color in Portland. They provide mass color in borders and flower beds. They are also perfectly suited to containers.</p>

                    <p>Perennial violas are smaller cousins of pansies that will bloom almost year-round in Portland. A dainty plant that fits in a mixed container or hanging basket, they are useful in planting beds, rock gardens, as a ground cover, and as additions to a mixed border. Preferring cooler weather for best bloom, they often put on a good show in spring, and then again in the fall through a mild winter.</p>

                    <p>Most species are small clump-forming plants with lobed, elliptical, kidney- or heart-shaped leaves. All Violas have remarkably similarly shaped 5-petalled flowers, with the lower petal often carrying dark markings.</p>

Their sweet fragrance is synonymous with the Victorian era.</p>

                <h2>Facts: Viola</h2>

                <p><strong>Family:</strong> Violaceae</p>

                <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Viola</p>

                <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Violet, Pansy</p>

                <p><strong>Origin:</strong> They are found in the most temperate regions of the world from the mountains of New Zealand to the subarctic. The greatest concentrations of species are found in North America, the Andes and Japan.</p>

                <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Perennial species are mostly very hardy and easily grown in shade. Annual bedding pansies and violas will do well in sun or shade. Most annual varieties will tolerate at least light frosts, and many are fully frost hardy. All violas prefer moist well-drained soil.</p>

                <p><strong>Care:</strong> To prolong bloom, regularly pinch off faded flowers (with some foliage) before they set seed. During the heat of summer annual varieties will begin to look ragged. Remove leggy plants and replant with new in the cooler fall weather.</p>

                <p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong> Relatively pest and disease free plants. Due to the cool, wet weather in Portland they can be damaged by slugs, powdery mildew and botrytis. V. odorata is susceptible to a virus transmitted by aphids.</p>
