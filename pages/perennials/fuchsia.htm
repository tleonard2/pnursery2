   <p>These pendulous lovelies are  represented in a genus of over 100 species of small or medium sized trees.&nbsp;Their growing habits are categorized by being  prostrate, trailing, upright lax (fountain), and upright. Leaves can be  opposite, alternate, or whorled. </p>
	<p>Flowers are usually borne in clusters along  the tips, are usually hanging and often are bi-colored. Flower color is often white,  pink, red, or purple although greens, peaches and yellows are beginning to  appear too. When talking about fuchsia  flowers the terms sepal, tube, and corolla are often used. </p>
	<p>The sepal and tube  are the exterior portions and the corolla is the interior. Spent flowers turn into an  edible fruit which has been suggested to have the flavor of grape spiced with black pepper. </p>
	<p>Highlights of these beauties  include:</p>
		    <ul>
		      <li>Extreme easy care once established. </li>
              <li>Attract humming birds like you wouldn't believe!</li>
              <li>Long blooming.</li>
              <li>There are over  2,000 cultivars to choose from!</li>

      <h2>Facts: Fuchsia </h2>
          <p><strong>Family:</strong>&nbsp; Onagraceae Family (Evening Primrose Family)</p>
          <p><strong>Genus:</strong>&nbsp; Fuchsia</p>
          <p><strong>Origin:</strong>&nbsp; South and Central America, with a few species  from New Zealand and Tahiti.</p>
          <p><strong>Culture:</strong>&nbsp; Fuchsia enjoy fertile moist soil with good  drainage. They like a situation that is mostly sunny to partly shady and are  heavy feeders during the growing season. Most are from the tropic and subtropical  regions which makes them an annual in our climate. Some species originate from  the Tierra Del Fuego region of South America and are generally the ones  considered hardy (perennial) in our climate. </p>
          <p>It is important to note that a  cold winter will knock even the hardy ones to the ground- although they will  re-sprout the following spring.</p>
          <p><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> Very few pests or diseases  are problems once fuchsias are established. Most problems can be avoided by  keeping the area clear around young plants clear of debris and keeping the soil  moist (not wet).</p>
          <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> By seed and cuttings.</p>
          <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong>&nbsp; Feed regularly (monthly) during the growing  season. Keep plants evenly watered. If you would like to create a bushier plant,  pinch off the tips as it grows as this will encourage side shoots.</p>
