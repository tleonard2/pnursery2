   <p>Asters belong to one of the largest, most diverse flowering plant families, Asteraceae. They have evolved to utilize insects and wind for extremely efficient pollination and seed dispersal. (Just think of the dandelion!) Asters are native throughout the globe with nearly fifty species native to the Pacific Northwest. In an effort to narrow this vast family, this article will focus on perennial species commonly used in the garden.</p>
  <p>Along with mums (also Asteraceae) and salvias, Asters are the swan song of flowering color in the garden. Their bloom season typically starts in July/Aug and goes into September/October. There is a wide array of flower color and size as well as plant height. Asters are also easy to grow! </p>

      <h2>Facts: Aster</h2>

<p><strong>Family: </strong>Asteraceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Aster </p>
<p><strong>Common name: </strong>Michaelmas Daisy </p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong>  250 species from throughout the northern hemisphere and South America. </p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong>   Most garden asters thrive in well drained, full to partial sun and regular summer water.  </p>
<p><strong>Pests &amp; Diseases:</strong>   Asters are generally pest free.  Powdery mildew &amp; rust are the major diseases.  If this occurs remove the infected foliage (if possible) and spray the plant with copper or other fungicide.    </p>
<p>Less common problems with asters include verticillium wilt, leaf spot, and leafhoppers (which transmit disease). </p>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong>  Asters can commonly flop in the garden by the time they are blooming.  To avoid this, simply prune back by one half to two thirds in early to mid June.  This practice often results in more flowers as well.    </p>
<p>Once the plants turn yellow in the fall, cut to the ground.   Fertilize in spring with an all-purpose slow release food. </p>
<p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Asters can be propagated by seed, division or cuttings all best done in spring.  Seeds can be sown indoors two weeks before the last frost or directly outdoors after the last frost.  Seed grown asters will bloom in their second year.  </p>
<p>Division of thick plants will allow for more air circulation, which makes the plant less prone to powdery mildew.  Use basal shoots or stems up to 2&rdquo; long for cuttings.  Keep cuttings moist until thoroughly rooted.</p>
