   <p>Here in the Pacific Northwest  the blooming of hellebores is a favorite late winter reminder that spring is  right around the corner. The genus of <strong><em>Helleborus</em></strong> is comprised of 15 different species and belongs to the buttercup family (<em>Ranunculaceae</em>). Hellebores are perennial  and largely evergreen. Their flowers provide color and interest in the shade  garden when other plants are dormant. In addition, their leaf structure is  interesting enough to make them a foundation of the shade garden year-round,  even when their flowers are spent. Hellebores are also deer resistant and somewhat  drought tolerant. </p>
<p>Hellebores are usually low growing plants with  short-stemmed, often toothed, palmate foliage. Their most impressive feature is  their five-petal bowl-shaped flowers which appear from late winter into spring  in colors as diverse as apricot, yellow, green, metallic blue, slate, dusky  pink, maroon and white. In addition, petals may be spotted or picoteed,  referring to the narrow band of darker color found on the edge of the petals.  Some varieties feature double-petalled flowers, giving them a nostalgic  rose-like quality.</p>

      <h3>FACTS: HELLEBORE </h3>

          <p><strong>Family:</strong> Ranunculaceae</p>
          <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Helleborus</p>
          <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Hellebore, Lenten Rose, Christmas Rose</p>
          <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Temperate  zones from Europe to Western China; many grow in the Balkan region of Southeastern Europe.</p>
          <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Most  prefer woodland conditions with deep, fertile, humus-rich, well-drained soil  and dappled shade. Hellebores can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions as  long as plants have good drainage. </p>
          <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Easy  to grow in the shade garden. They are an excellent companion for hostas,  woodland flowers, ferns and other shade-loving plants. </p>
          <p>Many hellebores are  evergreen but benefit from having old foliage removed before they bloom in late  winter to early spring. In the shadiest conditions plants may be smaller and  flowering may be sparse. In addition, they don&rsquo;t like to be divided or  transplanted.</p>
          <p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong> Hellebores have few  problems with disease but they are susceptible to black fungal rot. Keep an eye  out for aphids. Slugs and snails also are known to attack young growth.</p>
