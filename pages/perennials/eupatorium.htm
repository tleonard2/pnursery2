   <h3>FACTS: EUPATORIUM </h3>
    <p><strong>Family:</strong> Asteraceae</p>
    <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Eupatorium</p>
    <p><strong>Origin:  </strong>Found in Europe, North Africa, Central Asia and eastern North America.   Common Name: Joe-Pye Weed, Hardy Ageratum</p>
    <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Prefer soils high in organic matter (fertile). Likes to be evenly moist while getting established, but afterward is fairly drought tolerant. Needs some water in the summer during the heat waves. Prefer sun or part shade locations in the garden. <em>Eupatorium rugosum</em> 'Chocolate' needs more sun then others for better development of color.</p>
    <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> If you would like <em>Eupatorium</em> to be shorter and bloom later in the season, pinch back the stems in May or June. Cut back during fall/winter clean up when the plant is dormant. If planted in the open windy areas the plant might need to be staked for support. Leaving the seed heads after bloom period will add longer seasonal interest.  Keep in mind that if you do so blooms will mature, become fertile, and will reseed. </p>
    <p><strong>Pests:</strong> Leaf miners</p>
    <p><strong>Diseases: </strong>Mildew, leaf spot</p>
    <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Division in winter and spring; some varieties self-sow</p>
    <p></p>
