   <p>Sedums or stonecrops are the new darlings of the garden and with  good reason, from their diversity of form and color to their easy care and ability  to make it in those dry hot-spots (which need to be well-drained)! </p>
	  <img src="../images/sedum/shoes360.jpg" alt="Sedum shoes" width="360" height="259" class="center" /><p class="clear">When I walk  through my garden, I am surprised at all the little nooks and crannies that I  find sedums spilling out of. As I watch them grow, they keep on surprising me  with their changing color of foliage then the flowers pop out with these mounds  of tiny five-petalled star shaped flowers on slender stalks that look  impossible to be from the same plant. </p>
	  <p> With the arrival of fall, the brilliant  colors of the trees echo in the small sedum leaves as they turn brilliant red,  magenta and purple. The taller, shrubby sedums are showing off their flowers  now, making the bees drunk on nectar for one of the last hurrahs of summer. I  will leave the seed heads from the flowers up most of the winter for a bit of  winter interest after everything else has died down. </p>
	  <p>Sedums are commonly called  stonecrop because it is often found growing on and amongst stones. Whether it  is a low-growing groundcover-type sedum or an upright shrubby-type sedum, they  all have fleshy succulent leaves of various sizes, colors, and shapes, like  full sun, good drainage, and are mostly drought-tolerant. Most bloom in the  summer or fall with flowers of either yellow, white, or pink. </p>
      <p>Sedums work great in a rock or alpine garden or as  a splash of interest in a rock wall. In a container, they could be great filler  for that late season interest or as a cute little spiller for an extra  surprise. It is hard to go wrong with a few cute sedums potted up in a  container or basket. They are a favorite for green-roofs because they do not  need a lot of soil and love those conditions. </p>
      <p>The flowers are great for  attracting butterflies and bees and make a good cut flower. Planted with other  drought-tolerant plants like grasses, coneflowers, asters, and penstemon one  could have an easy care, attractive garden. There are also some varieties of  native sedums that are very, very cool.</p>
      <p>Here are a few of our favorite Sedums:</p>
      <div class="genuscontainerwide">
        <p><strong><em>S. acre</em> (Goldmoss  sedum)</strong> - Great little evergreen groundcover, 2-5 inches tall with upright  branchlets from trailing stems. This sedum originates from Europe, Turkey and North Africa. <strong>&lsquo;Aureum&rsquo;</strong> has pale green leaves with  yellow tips and bright yellow flowers. Zone 5.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="genuscontainerwide"> <a href="../images/sedum/autumnjoy.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/sedum/autumnjoy150.jpg" alt="Sedum 'Autumn Joy'" width="150" height="161" border="0" class="left" /></a><p><strong><em>S.</em> &lsquo;Autumn Joy&rsquo;</strong> -  A hybrid between <em>S. telephium</em> and <em>S. spectabile</em> that is an upright shrubby  sedum reaching 1-2 feet tall and 2 feet wide. The green leaves are rounded 2-3  inches long and wide and in the autumn the plant is topped with mounds of pink  flowers that age to a coppery pink and eventually to a rust color. It dies back  in winter. Zone 3-10.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="genuscontainerwide">
  <p><strong><em>S. spectabile (Showy Sedum) </em></strong> - There are many cultivars of this shrubby sedum originating from China and Korea. It grows about 18 inches  tall and wide with upright or slightly spreading stems and roundish, 3 inch  leaves and dies to the ground in the winter. In late summer and fall these  plants are adorned with large domes of flowers in shades of pink about 6 inches  wide that the bees and butterflies love. These might need staking if the  flower-heads get too heavy. Zone 4.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="genuscontainerwide">
  <p> <strong><a href="../images/sedum/tricolor-monr.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/sedum/tricolor-monr150.jpg" alt="Sedum 'Tricolor'" width="150" height="170" border="0" class="left" /></a>&lsquo;John Creech&rsquo;</strong> with tight green foliage  that turns burgundy in the fall, and <strong>&lsquo;Tricolor&rsquo;</strong> with green leaves and cream and red edging. Zone 4. </p></div>

          <h3>FACTS: SEDUM </h3>
          <p><strong>Family:</strong> Crassulaceae</p>
          <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Sedum</p>
          <p><strong>Origin</strong>: Sedums come from the Northern hemisphere, with around 400  species coming mostly from mountainous areas. </p>
          <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Full sun in well-draining, poor to moderate soil. Drought-tolerant  but appreciates some water at flowering time.</p>
          <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Shrubby-type sedums need to be cut down to the  crown in the late fall once foliage starts to look bad, or in the spring if the  seed heads are left for winter interest. The shrubby-types also might need  staking if they are in too rich of soil. Creeping sedums benefit from having the  flower heads cut back to maintain their shape. Easy!</p>
          <p>Because of their diverse looks and sizes, they fit many roles  in the garden or as container plants. Many groundcover varieties are evergreen  or semi-evergreen while the taller sedums die back to the ground to re-emerge  as cute rosettes in spring. </p>
          <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Easy to propagate from stem cuttings, sometimes  detached leaves will even root and form new plants.</p>
          <p><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> Snails and slugs can be a problem early  in the season. </p>
