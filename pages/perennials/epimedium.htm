   <p>The first words that come to mind in describing the genus of Epimedium are dainty, finely textured, durable, and easy. </p>
      <p>Dainty describes the clusters of small flowers in early spring. Epimedium flowers come in a range of colors including white, yellow, apricot, rose, and lilac. Their size varies from &frac12;&quot; to 3&quot; (E. grandiflorm) in diameter. They are borne on branched stems which lends them the appearance of floating above the ground. The individual flowers are little nodding cups, often with spurs like columbine. </p>
      <p>The flowers usually appear in April or May. At this time you can cut away the foliage from the previous year to keep it fresh and to accentuate the blooms. Finely textured describes the foliage of Epimediums. The compound leaves arise from the ground on thin wiry stems. Leaf shape varies slightly from heart shaped to lanceolate. They unfurl in shades of bronze or spring green. </p>
      <p>Most species are evergreen in our climate.  Durable describes the Epimedium&rsquo;s ability to tie the shade garden together in some of the most difficult of garden conditions. Especially since they are one of the few evergreen ground covers that can live successfully in dry shade! They can grow in partial to full shade with shallow rhizomes that make them perfect for under trees. </p>
      <p>Generally these tough plants prefer a cool woodland situation under deciduous trees. Watering is always necessary through the first season to help them get established. Please refer to species listing below for drought tolerance. Furthermore, many species can with stand temperatures down to -10&#730;F (they grow in Maine!) As always check individual species listings for zone ratings. </p>
      <p>One more thing to add, Epimediums are deer resistant.  The last and extremely appealing word is easy. There are some basic planting guide lines to make this testimonial come true. Amend the top 4-8&rdquo; of soil with compost (the ratio is 2/3 soil, 1/3 compost.) It&rsquo;s always nice (but not necessary) to throw in some all purpose or transplanting fertilizer in the bottom of the hole. Keep plants moist through their first season so they can establish. </p>
      <p>They are best planted in spring, fall or in the cooler parts of an early summer day. Epimediums do not thrive in hot sun. So position them in partial to dappled shade. They can grow in deep shade, but will bear sporadic blooms. These perennials are virtually pest free.  Here at Portland Nursery we carry some of the more durable, showy Epimediums. We have listed some of our &ldquo;regulars.&rdquo; Please call either location for current availability. </p>
