<p>Astilbe have been cultivated since the late 1700s and have become a staple in the shade garden. They offer a feathery texture with the foliage and great vertical, fluffy spires of flowers. Blooms in June, July, or August come in shades of pink, lavender, red, and white and are wonderful as cut flowers when many blooms of the shade garden have past.</p>
<p>Besides their lovely appearance, Astilbe are one of the best choices for the ever&ndash;so&ndash;common semi&ndash;shady moist spot in the garden. With that in mind, they combine well with hosta, Acorus, Ligularia, ferns, Pulmonaria, and Japanese iris. Since they have been admired for centuries there is an overwhelming array of varieties and hybrids available. Here we have broken down the varieties into the major groups, which share characteristics such as bloom time density, and vigor.</p>
