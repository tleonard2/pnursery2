   <p>Astilbe have been cultivated since the late 1700s and since have become a staple in the shade garden. They offer a feathery texture with the foliage and great vertical, fluffy spires of flowers.  Blooms in June, July, or August come in shades of pink, lavender, red, and white and are wonderful as cut flowers when many blooms of the shade garden have past.  </p>
   <p>Besides their lovely appearance, Astilbe are one of the best choices for the ever&ndash;so&ndash;common semi&ndash;shady moist spot in the garden. With that in mind, they combine well with hosta, Acorus, Ligularia, ferns, Pulmonaria, and Japanese iris. Since they have been admired for centuries there is an overwhelming array of varieties and hybrids available. Here we have broken down the varieties into the major groups, which share characteristics such as bloom time density, and vigor. </p>

      <h3>FACTS:  ASTILBE </h3>

<p><strong>Family:</strong> Saxifragaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Astilbe</p>
<p><strong>Common Name: </strong>False Spiraea</p>
<p><strong>Origin: </strong>The genus Astilbe consists of approximately 12 species from east Asia and North America. </p>
<p><strong>Culture: </strong>Astilbe are hardy, deciduous perennials that thrive in partial or dappled shade and moist soils. They can grow in well&ndash;drained soils with regular water and along the moist edge of a pond. It is essential Astilbe do not dry out in summer.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance: </strong>Astilbe require little maintenance other than division of old plants when the center of the clump dies out (about every three years). Encourage maximum blooms with yearly fertilizing with compost and/or a granular all&ndash;purpose fertilizer. </p>
<p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong> As with other members of the Saxifrage family, Astilbes are susceptible to root weevil.  They can be controlled with beneficial nematodes in the spring. </p>
