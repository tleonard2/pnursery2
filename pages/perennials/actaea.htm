<h2>In spring, while pastel colored ephemerals dominate gardens around the city, Actaeas are beginning to emerge from dormancy. Varieties with jet black foliage provide excellent color contrast for other early blooming shade beauties.</h2>
<p>In May and June, many gardens have reached their peak of bloom, while Acteas have filled in with lacy foliage in the background. Then in July, when it is becoming difficult to find flowers in shady areas, long spikes of fragrant white flowers which glow shockingly bright and seem to float in midair. The return of cool weather brings drying seed heads, their spiky outline still visible.</p>
<p>Black foliaged varieties are even darker when grown in full sun (with adequate water). Into the fall their foliage, black, and reliable as ever, lends beauty to late season interest plants such as <em>Fuchsias, Aconitum,</em> and grasses.</p>
<p>Green foliage varieties are less tolerant of hot sun, but continue to add height and texture to shade gardens until November. They combine well with hostas, calla lilies and black mondo grass.</p>
<p>Did you know? Bugbanes have recently been reclassified from <em>Cimicifuga</em> to <em>Actaea.</em> However they have been classified, they have been admired for many decades. Native Americans used <em>Actaea racemosa</em> (Black Cohosh) for snake bites, and it continues to be used in modern herbal medicine for a variety of ailments.</p>

<h2>Facts: Actaea</h2>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Ranunculaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Actaea (syn. Cimicifuga)</p>
<p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Bugbane, Cohosh, Baneberry, Snakeroot, Fairy Candles, Doll’s Eyes, Herb Christopher</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> <em>A. racemosa</em> and <em>A. pachypoda</em> — East coast of N. America from Ontario to Georgia.</p>
<p><em>A. simplex</em> and <em>A. matsumurae</em> – Mongolia, Eastern Russia, and Japan.</p>
<p>Other species extend the native range even further, but are not commonly cultivated.</p>
<p><em>A. elata</em> — Pacific NW</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Plant in part sun to part shade. At the coast or in cooler regions, it can be planted in full sun.  In Portland, protection from the hottest sun of the day, or supplimental water is important to prevent leaf scorch.</p>
<p>Full shade will result in plants that reach for light or fall over, greener leaves (as opposed to the desired purple) and sparse flowers.</p>
<p>Actaeas prefer rich, deep soil where water doesn’t pool in winter with supplemental water in the dry months. Hardy in zones 4-9.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Easy care! Water deeply about once a week in dry weather, and cut back in fall when leaves brown.</p>
<p><strong>Additional qualities:</strong> Attracts butterfliles and other pollinators.  Deer resistant. Cut flowers and attractive seed pods.  Tolerates moist soil.  Fragrant flowers.</p>
<p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong> Actaeas are generally easy to keep free of pests and diseases; apply Sluggo Plus to prevent cutworms in the fall and spring if leaves have been eaten in the past. Root rot is a possibility in poorly drained soils, if planting in a boggy spot, consider amending the soil with pumice at planting time.</p>
