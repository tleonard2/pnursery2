                    <h2>AGASTACHE: Giant Hyssop</h2>

                    <p>Imagine you are peacefully sitting enjoying the beauty of your garden, drinking some refreshing beverage and out of nowhere a hummingbird buzzes right by your ear and stops to drink from an orange flower spike of an <strong><em>Agastache</em></strong>. The iridescent green back and ruby throat of the hummingbird glitter for a fleeting moment, and then it is gone again, off to another nectar source.</p>

                    <p>Planting <em>Agastache</em>, also called Giant hyssop or Mexican hyssop, brings this kind of summer excitement to the hummingbird garden<em>. Agastache</em> is a great summer to fall garden bloomer that fits well in the herb garden or perennial border.</p>

                    <p>Long spikes of whorled flowers that range in color from white, orange, pink, mauve, and purple set against green to gray-green aromatic foliage are spectacularly attractive to hummingbirds and other beneficial garden insects.</p>

                    <p><em>Agastache</em> love full sun with excellent drainage to prevent them from rotting out over our wet winters, and grow anywhere from 18 in. to 6 ft tall. Some species of <strong><em>Agastache</em></strong> are also used in herbal medicines and teas. In addition to the various species, there are also many great cultivars and hybrids with a range of plant sizes and flower colors that would be great additions to any garden.</p>
