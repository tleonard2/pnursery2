<p>A sizable genus of sun loving, drought tolerant perennials that offers a variety of sensations to the late summer garden.&nbsp; Agastache provide delightlfully fragrant foliage, coloful spikes of blooms summer to fall that delight the hummingbirds, bees, butterflies and gardener alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine you are peacefully sitting enjoying the beauty of your garden, drinking some refreshing beverage and out of nowhere a hummingbird buzzes right by your ear and stops to drink from an orange flower spike of an <em>Agastache</em>.</p>
<p>The iridescent green back and ruby throat of the hummingbird glitter for a fleeting moment, and then it is gone again, off to another nectar source.&nbsp; This nectar also attracts bees, butterflies and other helpful pollinators.</p>
<p>Planting <em>Agastache</em>, also called Giant hyssop or Mexican hyssop, brings this kind of summer excitement to the garden. <em>Agastache</em> is a great summer to fall garden bloomer that fits well in the herb garden, containers&nbsp;or perennial border.</p>
<p>Long spikes of whorled flowers that range in color from white, orange, pink, mauve, and purple set against green to gray-green aromatic foliage are spectacularly attractive to hummingbirds and other beneficial garden insects.</p>
<p><em>Agastache</em> love full sun with excellent drainage to prevent them from rotting out over our wet winters, and grow anywhere from 18 in. to 6 ft tall. Some species of <em>Agastache, such as A. foeniculum (Anise hyssop),</em>&nbsp;are also used in herbal medicines and teas. In addition to the various species, there are also many great cultivars and hybrids with a range of plant sizes and flower colors that would be great additions to any garden.</p>
