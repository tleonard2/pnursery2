<p>Coreopsis flowers are so much fun in the garden landscape! These carefree perennials are literally covered with brilliant, freshly colored flowers all summer and into the fall. Their single heads on tall, slim stems create a full habit that adds a bright playfulness to the garden. It looks beautiful as a lively accent near trees and shrubs, in containers or planted up on a green roof (like ours at the nursery is!).</p>
<p>The abundant flowers come in a broad array of colors and combinations from creamy yellow, radiant oranges and reds, to vibrant hot pink and are generally about 1-2&rdquo; diameter each. Many species grow to around 2-3&rsquo; tall and wide, although some grow as small as 8&rdquo; and others over 5&rsquo;. The leaves vary from simple, dissected to ferny. Talk about diversity!</p>
<p>Coreopsis is a tough perennial that thrives in full sun in the cottage boarder, intense parking strip or mixed container. &nbsp;A versitle plant&nbsp;which combines well with <em>echinacea</em>, grasses and <em>perovskia</em>.</p>
<p>There are now literally dozens of varieties available of these long bloomers- Many are great cut flowers and attract butterflies. Coreopsis is a group that breeders are having fun playing with right now- which will mean more amazing types for us all to drool over! Below is listed a few of our new favorites and some classics you will want to try as well.</p>

<h2>Facts: Coreopsis</h2>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Asteraceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Coreopsis.</p>
<p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Tickseed</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> About 80 species of annuals and perennials widely distributed throughout the Americas, especially in the prairies through to the southwestern USA and Mexico</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Full sun and average soil. Very rich or heavily fertilized soil can cause the plants to become floppy and overgrown. Good drainage is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Coreopsis are quite low maintenance. They are drought tolerant once established but benefit from some moisture when in bloom over the dry summer months. Be careful not to over-water or let the plant sit in standing water and keep fertilizing to a minimum. Tall varieties will need to be staked.</p>
<p>Coreopsis plants benefit from deadheading during their summer bloom period to encourage additional flowering. Cut entire plant back in winter after the first frost.</p>
<p>Older plants have a tendency to decline in vigor. To regenerate, dig up plant and separate the new growth from the older plant. Replant the newer sections and discard</p>
<p><strong>Additional qualities:&nbsp;</strong>Attracts bees, butterflies and birds. &nbsp;Deer resistant. &nbsp;Drought tolerant. Great cut flowers.</p>
<p><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> Mildew and root rot are the most common diseases- avoid overwatering or planting in soggy areas.</p>
<p>Protect against slugs as new growth emerges in the spring.</p>
<p>Coreopsis beetle is a new pest in the Portland area. &nbsp;It is especially active when night temperatures are above 55&ordm;F, leaving skeletonized leaves. &nbsp;The adult beatles are black with cream stripes. &nbsp;They are best controlled by hand picking them off the plants. &nbsp;The larval stages can be controlled with Bt if caught early enough.</p>
