   <p>Russian sage is neither Russian nor a sage but this low maintenance,  showy perennial is a great choice for both beginning and experienced gardeners.  </p>
	  <p>With its shrubby habit, silvery grey-green leaves, beautiful lavender flowers,  and long bloom time it is an attractive addition to any border or bed. Once  established this plant is reliably drought tolerant. It also prefers hot dry  heat so if you have a hot spot in your garden and just don&rsquo;t know what to put  there this plant is your answer. </p>
	  <p>Perovskia looks like a lavender on steroids  with its own sweet, sage-like, high desert fragrance. The stems of this  perennial can also be cut for dried flower arrangements or left on the plant  for nice fall color. A good plant to combine with Perovskia would be Rudbeckia,  Agastache, sedums or ornamental grasses.</p>
