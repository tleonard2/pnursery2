   <p>Sedums, or stonecrops, are easy to grow given good drainage and adequate sun.  They are economical because they grow quickly, and are simple to propagate.  Plus they are  outstanding performers in containers, pathways, parking strips and much more.  Their durability with drought conditions and shallow soil has helped them become the stars of green roof and living wall designs.   Their range of foliage color and texture make them perfect plants for living art such as hanging pictures, wreaths and much more.  </p>
	  <p>If you want your creations to have year round interest it is nice choose varieties from the following list of creeping types, all of evergreen or semi-evergreen in Portland (USDA zone 8). </p>
	  <p>Sedums are commonly called  stonecrop because it is often found growing on and amongst stones. Whether it  is a low-growing groundcover-type sedum or an upright shrubby-type sedum, they  all have fleshy succulent leaves of various sizes, colors, and shapes, like  full sun, good drainage, and are mostly drought-tolerant. Most bloom in the  summer or fall with flowers of either yellow, white, or pink. </p>
      <p>Sedums work great in a rock or alpine garden or as  a splash of interest in a rock wall. In a container, they could be great filler  for that late season interest or as a cute little spiller for an extra  surprise. It is hard to go wrong with a few cute sedums potted up in a  container or basket. They are a favorite for green-roofs because they do not  need a lot of soil and love those conditions. </p>
      <p>The flowers are great for  attracting butterflies and bees and make a good cut flower. Planted with other  drought-tolerant plants like grasses, coneflowers, asters, and penstemon one  could have an easy care, attractive garden. There are also some varieties of  native sedums that are very, very cool.</p>

      <h3>FACTS: SEDUM </h3>
          <p><strong>Family:</strong> Crassulaceae</p>
          <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Sedum</p>
          <p><strong>Origin</strong>: Sedums come from the Northern hemisphere, with around 400  species coming mostly from mountainous areas. </p>
          <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Full sun in well-draining, poor to moderate soil. Drought-tolerant  but appreciates some water at flowering time.</p>
          <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Shrubby-type sedums need to be cut down to the  crown in the late fall once foliage starts to look bad, or in the spring if the  seed heads are left for winter interest. The shrubby-types also might need  staking if they are in too rich of soil. Creeping sedums benefit from having the  flower heads cut back to maintain their shape. Easy!</p>
          <p>Because of their diverse looks and sizes, they fit many roles  in the garden or as container plants. Many groundcover varieties are evergreen  or semi-evergreen while the taller sedums die back to the ground to re-emerge  as cute rosettes in spring. </p>
          <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Easy to propagate from stem cuttings, sometimes  detached leaves will even root and form new plants.</p>
          <p><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> Snails and slugs can be a problem early  in the season. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

           <p>Grows 1-2 feet tall and 2 feet wide. The green leaves are rounded 2-3  inches long and wide</p>
           <p>In the autumn the plant is topped with mounds of pink  flowers that age to a coppery pink and eventually to a rust color. Dies back  in winter. Zone 3-10.</p>
