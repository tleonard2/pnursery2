	                                <h2>EUPHORBIA</h2>

                    <p>One of the most dramatic plants for your garden, Euphorbia offer a diversity of height, form, color and habit. The genus is expansive, including more than 2,000 species of herbaceous perennials, annuals, biennials, as well as evergreen and deciduous shrubs and trees.</p>

                    <p>There is a Euphorbia to meet every garden need. In our gardens here in the Pacific Northwest perennial Euphorbias can be used as a specimen plant, in borders, in containers, mass plantings and rock gardens. Also worth noting is that most perennial Euphorbia are largely evergreen and drought tolerant once established.</p>

                    <p>At Portland Nursery, during the holiday season, we offer a tender euphorbia known as Poinsettias (<em>Euphorbia pulcherrima).</em> Found in colors ranging from striking red to creamy pink, Poinsettias are native to a moist, subtropical environment so must be kept indoors in the Pacific Northwest. In addition, they need 3 to 4 hours of direct sunlight a day which can be achieved by placing them in front of a sunny window. With regular water, festive Poinsettias will last into the New Year.</p>

                    <p>Portland Nursery also carries other tender varieties of Euphorbia. Some of these are largely found in our Division Store&rsquo;s cactus house, while another kind is a popular annual for sun to part shade. Known as Euphorbia &lsquo;Diamond Frost&rsquo; this annual is 12 to 18 inches tall and has masses of pure white bracts above finely textured apple green foliage. With pretty blooms through the whole growing season, this cheery annual is perfect for pots and hanging baskets.</p>

                    <p>Portland Nursery&rsquo;s largest selection of Euphorbia are the herbaceous perennials which range widely in color and size. These Euphorbias are valued for their whorled leaves, with colors ranging from bluish-green to variegated green colors all the way to dark bronze-purple. Typical perennial Euphorbia require a sunny location with well drained soil that is protected from frost and wind. The Pacific Northwest, having been compared to a Mediterranean climate because of the dry summers, is a great place to grow Euphorbia.</p>

                    <p>Worth noting is that because some kinds of Euphorbia prolifically self-seed (thereby potentially spreading into wilderness areas) these kinds of Euphorbia can no longer be carried at Oregon nurseries, including Portland Nursery. This limit includes <em>Euphorbia myrsinites</em> (donkey tail spurge), a popular rock garden perennial. However, we are more than happy to assist you in finding an alternative to a particular desired plant.</p>

It thrives in locations with full sun to partial shade throughout USDA Hardiness Zones 6-9. Once established, it is heat and drought resistant with few cultural problems.</p>

                <h3>FACTS: EUPHORBIA</h3>

                <p><strong>Family:</strong> Euphorbiaceae</p>

                <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Euphorbia</p>

                <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Spurge, Euphorbia</p>

                <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Southwestern Asia, Britain, Europe, Mediterranean</p>

                <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Most prefer well-drained, light soil in full sun, although some Euphorbia prefer moist, humus-rich soil in part shade or permanently moist soil in full sun.</p>

                <p><strong>Pests and Disease:</strong> When grown in too wet soil, collar rot can occur. In addition, some kinds of Euphorbia are susceptible to powdery mildew. Otherwise Euphorbia are generally pest free.</p>

                <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Most Euphorbia resent transplanting, but otherwise are easy to maintain. After flowering, the dead stems on the plant should be cut back to the area of new growth. Importantly, tidying the plant will promote more growth to occur.</p>

                <p>In addition, it is extremely important to wear protective gloves when working with Euphorbia because they exude a white sap that is a skin irritant and can be poisonous if ingested.</p>

                <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Depending on the species or cultivar propagate by seeding, division or cuttings.</p>
