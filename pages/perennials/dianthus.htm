                    <h2>DIANTHUS: Carnation</h2>

                    <p>Dianthus have so much to offer, edible flowers, evergreen foliage, drought tolerant, fragrant and even cut flowers. Best of all, Dianthus are easy to grow with a minimum of five hours of full sun. The low growing varieties are great in rock gardens and lining pathways.</p>

                    <p>Sweet Williams and carnations are excellent long lasting cut flowers. There are also brilliant bedding types that offer color all summer. Dianthus flowers are commonly found in shades of reds, pinks and white, and have a sweet clove scent. Some carnation varieties are available in yellows and oranges.</p>

                    <p>Perennial varieties tend to bloom in May and June, with Sweet Williams, Carnations and annual varieties blooming through out the summer.</p>
