   <p>Here in the Pacific  Northwest, mostly everyone is familiar with the appearance of ferns in the woodlands. Big sword ferns nestle on the ground underneath the soaring cedars and Douglas firs, while maidenhair ferns daintily flutter as they cling to rocks along a waterfall. Deer ferns will be a surprise at eye level growing on the knobby bark of an old maple tree.</p>
<p>Ferns are also useful garden plants, especially in the shade garden or the woodland garden. They add softness and texture underneath trees in a woodland garden. Ferns can be a filler plant in the shade garden, or they can be the striking feature plant. Some ferns grow as individual plants, while others will spread and make colonies. </p>
<p>Ferns are a great plant for a shade container, and evergreen ferns are great in containers for winter color. Ferns are also very easy, requiring little maintenance.</p>
<p>This month's featured genus, <em>Dryopteris</em>, is the most numerous genus of ferns, with over 200 species. They are found in the forests, fields, and wet areas of the Northern Hemisphere, with many being found in eastern Asia and the Himalayas. </p>
<p>They are attractive ornamental ferns, with upright arching fronds that look great in mixed borders with other perennials. Many species are evergreen. When the fiddleheads are unfurling, many of the <em>Dryopteris</em> have attractive scales in the tips, as well as along the base of the stipe in mature fronds. </p>
<p><em>Dryopteris</em> freely hybridize in the wild, making them sometimes difficult to identify, but also producing many different plants and features that makes them good ornamental plants. All the Dryopteris are sturdy, strong-growing garden plants with few problems which makes them easy and versatile. </p>
