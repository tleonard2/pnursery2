   <p><strong><em>Polystichum</em></strong> is a wonderful addition to any  shade garden. Not only are they pretty to look at with their lacy frond  structures, they are also evergreen, giving the gardener something interesting  and enjoyable to look at through every season. </p>
	  <p>These ferns work well in mass  plantings (fern glens), as a back drop to herbaceous perennials, and also in  containers. Though they prefer rich moist soils they adapt well to poor soils  and tight conditions, sometimes emerging out of the cracks of rocks. </p>
	  <p>Some <em>Polystichum</em> are native to this area and  thrive in the Northwest because of our acidic soils and moderate temperatures.  They scatter our forest floors with their enduring evergreen elegance, helping  to make the great Northwest one of the most beautiful places to live. </p>
	  <p>A few of  our favorites are: </p>

      <h2>Facts: Polystichum</h2>
      <p><strong>Family:</strong>&nbsp;  Dryopteridacea</p>
      <p><strong>Genus:</strong>&nbsp; <em>Polystichum</em> </p>
      <p><strong>Common Name:</strong>&nbsp;  Fern</p>
      <p><strong>Origin:</strong>&nbsp; <em>Polystichum</em> ferns hail from a  wide variety of places, including North America, Eastern Asia, Europe and Oceana. The name is from the Greek (poly=many  and stichos=row).</p>
      <p><strong>Culture:</strong>&nbsp;  Most ferns are rugged, adapted not only to cold climates but to high  heat and humidity. They are well suited to any shade from light to dense and  tolerate light to medium sun exposure. These long lived plants will grow in  most any soil, but light, fertile woodland soil with plenty of humus is  preferred. </p>
      <p>They can be propagated by dividing rhizomes in very early spring or  in autumn after the fronds have died back. Under the right condition of moist  soils between 60 &amp; 70 degrees F ripe spores will germinate, making  naturalization easy.</p>
      <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong>&nbsp;  With good cultural conditions <em>Polystichum</em> are very low maintenance and very easy care. Clean-up is easy and straight  forward, just cut back the old dead foliage seasonally. Removing the spent  fronds encourages new growth and will guarantee beautiful evergreen ferns with  new fronds unfolding. </p>
      <p><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong>&nbsp; Larva of codling moth can make a home in the  tips of the frond, curling them and rolling them up. There are generally no  disease problems.</p>
