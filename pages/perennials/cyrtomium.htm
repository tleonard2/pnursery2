<p>In the Pacific Northwest <em>Cyrtomium</em>&nbsp;are reliably evergreen and a wonderful, easy to grow addition to any woodland garden or shade container. The common name "Holly Fern" derives from the shape of the frond which is similar to Holly and Oregon Grape. The dark green and glossy fronds make them a stand-out addition to the shade garden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cyrtomium is a small genus of 15 to 20 fast growing, terrestrial or rock-inhabiting fern species from around the world. &nbsp;Fronds generally range in length from 1 to 2 1/2 feet in length. &nbsp;Holly ferns prefer moist conditions as they are largely native to damp forests or river banks. &nbsp;They thrive in acidic, nutrient rich soil with good drainage. &nbsp;Propigation through division is best in autumn or early spring. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These bold ferns&nbsp;make great companion plants for larger Hostas and other large-leaved perennials. The serrated edges of Cyrtomium also contrast well with soft&nbsp;textured perennials such as Farfugium, Astilbe, Tiarella, Dicentra and Brunnera. &nbsp;Planted in shade containers, <em>Cyrtomium</em> work nicely with Pansies, Primroses, Hellebores, and ornamental grasses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holly ferns are so versitile they also make excellent houseplants. &nbsp;Since they thrive with moisture, they are a good choice for terrariums or bathrooms. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>FACTS: Cyrtomium</h2>
<p><strong>Family: </strong>Dryopteridaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus: </strong> Cyrtomium</p>
<p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Holly Fern</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Hawaii, East Asia to South Africa and Central to South America.</p>
<p><strong>Culture: </strong>Loose, nutrient rich, woodland soil with rocks or pumice to insure good drainage. Cyrtomium prefer abundant water in summer, less in winter. They tolerate drier air than most ferns and grow best in medium to high light. Keep them out of direct sunlight in summer.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance: </strong>Cyrtomium are evergreen and require minimal cleanup in early spring before new fronds emerge. Prune back damaged and old looking fronds to leave room for the newly emerging fronds.</p>
<p><strong>Additional qualities:&nbsp;</strong>Deer resistant, tolerates moist soil.</p>
<p><strong>Pests and Diseases: </strong>Slugs and snails are a potential threat to holly ferns, as is root rot due to poorly draining soil. Sluggo is a kid and pet friendly way to control slugs, and choosing an appropriate planting site is the best defense against root rot.</p>
