   <p>Geum is a long blooming member of the rose family which will reward you with flowers in shades of yellow, orange, red, or pink. The flowers are bee magnets and work well as a cut flower. It is a low allergen plant. The foliage ranges from deciduous to evergreen depending on species and conditions. </p>
  <p>An excellent addition to rock gardens or as a border, Geum combines well with many sun loving perennials. Also a tincture of Avens is an ingredient in some herbal medicines as a mild sedative. The hybrids below have breed bread for color, disease resistance, and long bloom. </p>

      <h2>Facts: Geum</h2>

<p><strong>Family:</strong> Rosaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Geum</p>
<p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Avens</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> This genus of about 50 herbaceous perennials is very wide spread. It hails from temperate regions of Europe, Asia, North and South America, South Africa, and New Zealand. There are about 6 species native to Oregon though it can be difficult to find them in nursery centers as these native ones can be aggressive spreaders.</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Frost hardy, they prefer sunny, well drained soil but they will grow in just about any condition as long as it is not waterlogged. Generally drought tolerant. Propagate from seed or by division in early spring.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance: </strong>Geum begin to flower less well after a few years and will become free-flowering again only if they are lifted and divided. This is a good time to cut back and discard old woody growth. Division should be done early spring. They can be grown from seed but tend to hybridize readily. Blooming will be extended if flowers are deadheaded.</p>
<p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong> Downy mildew, fungal leaf spot, powdery mildew, spider mites, and root weevils.</p>
