   <p>Bergenia are one of the tried  and true perennials.&nbsp; They are long lived  and &ldquo;tough as nails&rdquo;.&nbsp; They look fabulous  in old established plantings or in new beds. Their large bold leaves offer a  thick texture that easily works into just about any design style including  containers.</p>
	  <p>The paddle-shaped, evergreen  leaves of this spreading plant are best displayed when in mass. Spring brings  the lovely straight stems bearing sprays of flowers ranging from white to ruby  pink, to double red. The evergreen leaves of some varieties turn burgundy on  the tips in cold weather adding interest to the winter garden. Many wonderful  cultivars of this plant have been introduced. A few of our favorites are:</p>

      <h3>FACTS: BERGENIA </h3>
          <p><strong>Family:</strong> Saxifragaceae</p>
          <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Bergenia</p>
          <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Pigsqueak, heartleaf, Elephant ears.</p>
          <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Widely distributed in temperate Asia. There  are 8 species in the genus.</p>
          <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Rich, moist, well-drained soil. Would prefer to be on the dry side rather than  wet. Will tolerate a variety of sun to shade conditions. </p>
          <p>Leaves tend to look  better given a more shady situation and flowers tend to bloom more in a sunnier  situation. No matter where you plant it one of the wonderful qualities of this  plant will shine.</p>
          <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> &nbsp;Low-maintenance, drought tolerant and easy  to grow. Bergenias are an excellent companion for hellebores, hostas, primula,  brunnera, grasses &nbsp;and ferns. </p>
          <p>Bergenia  are evergreen but benefit from having sunburned, old or tatty winter foliage  cleaned up in the spring or growing season. In the shadiest conditions leaves  and flowering may be sparser. </p>
          <p>Large clumps can be easily divided by replanting  a good section of rhizome.</p>
      <p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong> Few problems bother bergenias. Root weevils can occasionally be a  problem, evidenced by notch shapes cut out of the edges of the leaves.</p>
