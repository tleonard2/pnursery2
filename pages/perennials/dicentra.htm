   <p>Bleeding hearts are a long standing, popular staple in the shade garden.  Old-fashioned bleeding heart, Dicentra spectabalis, has been cultivated in gardens since the 1840's and still reigns as the most widely grown of all the Dicentra.  How can one deny the beauty of this queen with dramatic, long wands of pendant, heart-shaped pink and white blooms.  </p>

   <p><em><strong>Dicentra spectabalis</strong></em></p>
   <p>This rich display of floral jewels is followed by the droplet blooms of our native <em>D. formosa </em>and the east coast native<em> D. eximia. </em>These two species readily cross pollinate, and have given rise to many garden hybrids.  The delicate feathery foliage of the Ameican native species is close to the ground, and adds great contrast to the bold leaves of hostas, wild ginger or grasses.  Dicentra spectabalis combines well with just about anything.  Because D. spectabalis goes dormant in summer, it often combines well with late blooming or evergreen perennials such as<em> Ligularia, Astilbe or Farfugium. </em></p>
   <p>The less common D. scandens is a vining species with clusters of bright yellow flowers from late summer through fall.  It is a wonderful plant to thread through flowering currants, Japanese Maples or train on a trellis. </p>
   <p>A newer series of hybrid Dicentra called the Heart series offer stunning, fern like foliage in shades of blue and green with clusters of large red, pink or white flowers on 10-12&quot; stems.  These Dicentra need very good drainage and can handle full sun (except in the hottest part of the day) as long as they receive regular water.  They are excellent specimens in the partially shaded rock garden.</p>
   <p>No matter which species of Dicentra you choose to grow, most are easy and low maintenance.  They can add a sense of elegance or woodland wonder to virtually any shade garden.  Even the fairies will approve.</p>

   <h3>FACTS: DICENTRA </h3>
     <p><strong>Family:</strong> Papaveracae</p>
     <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Dicentra</p>
     <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Bleeding Heart, Dutchman's Breeches, Lady in the Bath</p>
     <p><strong>Origin: </strong>This genus contains around 20 species native to North America, Japan and China.</p>
     <p><strong>Culture:  </strong>Dicentras are deciduous perennials that thrive in rich, well-drained soil in full to partial shade and regular water in the summer months. </p>
     <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Very easy, low-maintenance plants.  Cool soil will help the foliage last longer.  Once the leaves turn yellow, cut stems to the ground in summer (for D. spectabalis) or fall (for other species).  Some varieties spread by runners or reseed.</p>
