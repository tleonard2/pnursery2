The same thing happened with Dicentra spectabalis (the one after Dicentra formosa 'Aurora').  Then again with Dicentra scandens.  The first photo of Dicentra spectabalis seems to be a repeat of the banner photo.  What about changing that first photo to one of these? https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/04/22/19/40/bleeding-heart-1346421_960_720.jpg

I like the first one better because it shows some of the plants growth habit."

<p>Bleeding hearts are a long standing, popular staple in the shade garden. Old-fashioned bleeding heart, Dicentra spectabalis, has been cultivated in gardens since the 1840's and still reigns as the most widely grown of all the Dicentra. How can one deny the beauty of this queen with dramatic, long wands of pendant, heart-shaped pink and white blooms.</p>

<p><em><strong>Dicentra spectabalis</strong></em></p>
<p>This rich display of floral jewels is followed by the droplet blooms of our native <em>D. formosa </em>and the east coast native<em> D. eximia. </em>These two species readily cross pollinate, and have given rise to many garden hybrids. The delicate feathery foliage of the Ameican native species is close to the ground, and adds great contrast to the bold leaves of hostas, wild ginger or grasses. Dicentra spectabalis combines well with just about anything. Because D. spectabalis goes dormant in summer, it often combines well with late blooming or evergreen perennials such as<em> Ligularia, Astilbe or Farfugium. </em></p>
<p>The less common D. scandens is a vining species with clusters of bright yellow flowers from late summer through fall. It is a wonderful plant to thread through flowering currants, Japanese Maples or train on a trellis.</p>
<p>A newer series of hybrid Dicentra called the Amore&nbsp;series offer stunning, fern like foliage on vigorous plants. &nbsp;Prolific&nbsp;clusters of large rose or&nbsp;pink froom May to August! The Amore Dicentra have largely replaced the more difficult Heart series.&nbsp;They prefer to be evenly moist, but not wet during the growing season. &nbsp;Since these plants have attractive foliage and extended bloom time they are ideal for entry ways and prominent woodland paths or containers.</p>
<p>No matter which species of Dicentra you choose to grow, most are easy and low maintenance. They can add a sense of elegance or woodland wonder to virtually any shade garden. Even the fairies will approve.</p>
