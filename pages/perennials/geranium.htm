   <p>Gardeners are sometimes confused  by the differences between hardy geraniums (the subject of this discussion) and  annual geraniums, known as Pelargoniums. Annual geraniums (pelargoniums) come  almost exclusively from South Africa  and are not winter hardy in the Portland  area. They are container plants and bedding plants. </p>
<p>Hardy geraniums, on the  other hand, occur worldwide in temperate regions with representatives growing  in Europe, North America, New Zealand  and much of Asia. Geraniums are winter hardy  (perennial) and can be used in a variety of gardening conditions from rock  gardens to shady woodland gardens. Pelargoniums and Geraniums are both members  of the family Geraniaceae, along with Erodium, commonly known as storksbill. </p>
<p> Geraniums are referred to as  &ldquo;cranesbills&rdquo; because the plant&rsquo;s fruit resembles a crane&rsquo;s bill. The genus  geranium has four hundred species and countless cultivars. However, not all  geranium species are suitable for the garden as some are not hardy enough to  survive winters outdoors in northern climates, while others are very weedy in  nature. </p>
<p>Geraniums are known for the breadth of conditions they can tolerate,  from full sun to dry shade, as well as the ease with which they can be grown.  They are a favorite with bees with flower colors ranging from white, blue,  purple and a multitude of pinks. In addition, many of the flowers have  interesting variegation, veining and spotting. </p>
<p>Leaf colors range from green,  green with dark markings, green with yellow markings, as well as brown.  Geraniums can be fun and easy for any kind of gardener and garden condition. They  can liven up a rock garden or add texture and color to a romantic rose garden.  In addition, many work well in dappled shade conditions underneath deciduous  trees. Some of our favorite species and varieties commonly found at Portland  Nursery are discussed below.</p>

<h3>Geranium phaeum &lsquo;Samobor&rsquo;</h3>
<p><em>Geranium phaeum</em> is known as <a href="../images/geraniums/samobar.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/geraniums/samobar150.jpg" alt="Geranium phaeum 'Samobar'" width="150" height="100" border="0" class="left" /></a>dusky cranesbill. It is  extremely hardy, can withstand dry conditions and is almost evergreen. The mass  of leaves on this species form dense, vigorous mounds, making it excellent as a  ground cover. <em>Geranium phaeum</em> &lsquo;Samobor&rsquo; was found in 1990 near Croatia. The  flowers are burgundy and the leaves are green with a broad black-red band. This  variety can tolerate sun or shade and blooms in early summer.</p>

<h3>Geranium &lsquo;Johnson&rsquo;s Blue&rsquo;</h3>
<p>This geranium is a hybrid that <a href="../images/geraniums/johnsons_blue.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/geraniums/johnsons_blue150.jpg" alt="Geranium 'Johnson's Blue'" width="150" height="100" border="0" class="left" /></a>originated in Wales  between <em>G. himalayense</em> and <em>G. pretense</em>. The flower color is blue-violet and it  is tall and gorgeous during bloom with large flowers. Bloom time is early  summer and it can tolerate sun or partial shade. The plant&rsquo;s only weak point is  that it can have a hard time remaining upright. However, it responds well to  being cut back and will in turn respond with a new mound of green leaves and  sometimes flowers.</p>

<h3>Geranium &lsquo;Ann Folkard&rsquo;</h3>
<p>This geranium prefers sun to partial <a href="../images/geraniums/ann_folkard.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/geraniums/ann_folkard150.jpg" alt="Geranium 'Ann Folkard' photo courtesy Blooming Nursery" width="150" height="100" border="0" class="left" /></a>shade and blooms in  midsummer. Flower color is warm magenta-red with a black eye. This is a hybrid  of <em>G. procurrens</em> and <em>G. psilostemon</em>. From <em>G. procurrens</em> the hybrid gets its  long stems and from <em>G. psilostemon</em> it gets its shocking magenta-red flower and  black eye. The leaves are yellowish green and provide a striking contrast with  the flower color. It is worth noting&nbsp;  that this geranium may be a bit sensitive to very cold and wet winters.</p>

<h3>Geranium &lsquo;Ann Thompson&rsquo;</h3>
<p>This geranium is a hybrid with the <a href="../images/geraniums/annethomson_bellevuegardensociety.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/geraniums/annethomson_bellevuegardensociety150.jpg" alt="Geranium 'Anne Thompson' photo courtesy Bellevue Plant Society" width="150" height="100" border="0" class="left" /></a>same parents as Geranium  &lsquo;Ann Folkard.&rsquo; The two are very similar to each other although &lsquo;Ann Thompson&rsquo; has  slightly smaller flowers, the foliage is less yellowish green in color and &lsquo;Ann  Thompson&rsquo; is slightly more compact. Unfortunately, similar to &lsquo;Ann Folkard,&rsquo;  Ann Thompson&rsquo; is sometimes not hardy and may suffer in a very cold, wet winter.</p>

<h3>Geranium x oxonianum</h3>
<p>A hybrid of <em>G. versicolor</em> and <em>G. <a href="../images/geraniums/oxonianum_pearl_boland.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/geraniums/oxonianum_pearl_boland150.jpg" alt="Geranium x oxonianum 'Pearl Boland' photo courtesy Blooming Nursery" width="150" height="100" border="0" class="left" /></a>endresii</em>, this hybrid is  noteworthy for its huge variety of flower colors (white, all shades of pink and  burgundy) found in a number of cultivars. Known for blooming all summer in sun  or partial shade this hybrid can be enjoyed in the garden from early in the  year, when the plants form dense green mounds, until late autumn. </p>

<p>The varieties  of <em>Geranium x oxonianum </em>have many  uses in the garden as they tolerate some shade, grow quickly and are easy to  propagate. They can also be used as a groundcover. In addition to the flowers,  the leaves of this hybrid also show variation. Some varieties have a maroon  patch, while in others the leaves are totally green. After the primary  flowering in June, some may need cutting back, but they will soon be back on  track with fresh leaves and new flowers. This hybrid is also known for being  enormously fertile, thus producing many seeds. Some varieties that Portland  Nursery has carried include &lsquo;A.T. Johnson,&rsquo; &lsquo;Claridge Druce,&rsquo; &lsquo;Katherine  Adele,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pearle Boland&rsquo; (pictured above). </p>

            <h2>Facts: Hardy Geranium </h2>
          <p><strong>Family: </strong> Geraniaceae</p>
          <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Geranium</p>
          <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Geraniums  occur worldwide, mostly in temperate regions with representatives growing in  Europe, North America, New Zealand  and much of Asia.</p>
          <p><strong>Culture: </strong>Geraniums  are equally happy in light, acidic, sandy soil, in clay or alkaline conditions.  Geraniums are easy to grow and tough.&nbsp;They can tolerate a variety of conditions from full sun to deep shade.  </p>
          <p>Further, some prefer drier rock garden conditions, while others prefer more  moist woodland conditions. There are, therefore, geraniums suitable for every  type of gardening condition.</p>
          <p><strong>Pests and Diseases: </strong>Some  varieties may suffer from mildew but this can be dealt with by cutting them  back after bloom.</p>
          <p><strong>Maintenance: &nbsp;</strong>Care of geraniums is minimal. Organic  matter such as compost is all that is needed for fertilizing. Also, the tallest  plants can be cut back after flowering to prevent them from going to seed and  looking tired.</p>
          <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Many  varieties of geranium can be propagated from seed and division.</p>
