<h2>Brunnera is a wonderful&nbsp;shade plant through out the seasons. Early in spring, its clusters of striking clear blue flowers draw the eye and remind us that the time of lush abundance will soon return. New blooms continue to appear all through April and into May, during which time the leaves grow from tiny little hearts to big and showy in their own right. &nbsp;Through the summer and fall, Brunnera is&nbsp;an attractive foliage plant with big fuzzy leaves of silver or cream (depending on variety).</h2>
<p>Not only are Brunnera attractive, but they are also easy and durable. &nbsp;They prefer moist soils, and also tolerate drought. &nbsp;Being a member of the borage family, some varieties may reseed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The bold heart shaped leaves lend them to combining well with many plants such as grasses and hellebores. &nbsp;A nearby planting of <em>Dicentra spectabilis</em> 'Gold Heart' (Bleeding Heart) will make for a striking combination the memory of which even summer won't dispel. A mass of silvery leafed Brunneras can brighten even the darkest of spots, and help draw people into secluded areas.</p>
<p>Brunneras are also compact enough to make good container plants. They can help smooth the transition from winter's subdued pots to the floriferous annuals of summer, and their silvery foliage blends well with a wide variety of colors.</p>
<p>Some varieties you can find at Portland Nursery include:</p>

<h2>Facts: Brunnera</h2>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Boraginaceae</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> <em>Brunnera</em></p>
<p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Bugloss, False Forget-Me-Not</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> The only species in common cultivation, <em>Brunnera macrophylla</em>, is native to Eastern Europe and Russia including Siberia, hence its common name, Siberian Bugloss. The other two species extend its native range as far southwest as Lebanon; none are native outside Europe and Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong> <em>Brunnera</em> grows well in morning sun to full shade, in all but the driest of spots. In hot afternoon sun, it will need moist soil or the leaves will burn, but in the shade occasional water is sufficient. It performs well even in heavy soils, and requires very little to look good all season.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> A very hardy and easy to grow perennial, <em>Brunnera</em> requires only occasional water, cutting back in the fall (it is herbaceous) and deadheading at the end of its bloom time in May. Propagation is best done by division, and only as needed, since older, undivided clumps will have bigger leaves. <em>Brunnera</em> sometimes seeds itself in the garden; remove seedlings for a tidy appearance, or leave them for an eye-catching mass planting.</p>
<p><strong>Additional qualities</strong>: Attracts butterflies, hummingbirds and benificial insects. &nbsp;Deer resistant. &nbsp;Mildly drought tolerant.</p>
<p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong> Pests and diseases are not generally a concern for<em> Brunnera.</em></p>
