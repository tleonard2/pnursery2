   <p>There are 68 species in the genus <em>Kniphofia</em>, all originating in southern and eastern Africa. They form clumps of grass-like finely toothed  foliage with strong stems rising above the foliage with flowers that look-like  glowing pokers or torches, hence the common name. The blossoms open from the  bottom to top over the course of several days and change color as the blossoms  mature. Most varieties begin blooming by late June and some will re-bloom until  frost. </p>

<p><img src="../images/kniphofia/kniphofia_monr175.jpg" alt="Kniphofia hybrids" width="175" height="243" class="left" />Hybridizing has led to many different colors and sizes of plants for the  gardener to choose from. Flower color ranges from coral red through shades of  orange, peach, yellow to near white and light green, and size ranges from dwarf  plants 1 &frac12; feet tall to large 6 feet tall plants. Some are evergreen and some  deciduous dependent on the species. </p>

<p><strong><em>Kniphofia</em></strong> are a  plant that can be used in the garden to make a statement, such as the 6 feet  tall <em>K. northiae</em>, or used as a  vertical accent in the perennial border. It is also has a unique structural  look with the flowers stems rising above the foliage that would be a great  addition to a tropical garden paired with purple or red-foliage cannas, or a  more xeriscaped garden planted with grasses, <em>Echinacea</em>, and <em>Penstemon</em>. </p>
          <p>Some of the smaller varieties also make nice additions to containers for summer  bloom, and evergreen varieties give year-round interest. <em>Kniphofia </em>are attractive to hummingbirds and make a great addition  to the hummingbird garden.&nbsp;They also  make a great cut flower.</p>

      <h3>FACTS: KNIPHOFIA</h3>
          <p><strong>Family:</strong> Asphodelaceae</p>
          <p><strong>Genus:</strong> <em>Kniphofia</em></p>
          <p><strong>Common Name: </strong>Red Hot Poker, Torch Lily</p>
          <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native  to southern and eastern Africa</p>
          <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Plant  in full sun with moist, humus-rich well-drained soil. In the summer, <em>Kniphofia</em> can handle moisture, but they  need well-drained soil during the winter. Also, they need moisture when the  blooms are forming and will fail to flower if conditions are too dry. &nbsp;<em>Kniphofia</em> can tolerate wind and are a good choice for coastal plantings. </p>
          <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Diligent  deadheading (removing spent flower blossoms) will prolong the bloom season. In  the fall, remove the unsightly looking leaves and any dead flower stalks that  are left. For the winter, do not cut the foliage back, but instead try tying it  up over the center of the plant to protect the crown from winter moisture and  help insulate the crown to extend longevity. Mulching in the winter is helpful.  In the spring, once all the cold weather is past, cut the foliage back down to  about three inches from the ground to rejuvenate, but avoid pruning too close  to the crown. </p>
          <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Dig up  and divide clumps in the spring, unless it is flowering, in which case wait  until after the plant is done flowering.</p>
