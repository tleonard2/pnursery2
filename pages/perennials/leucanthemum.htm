  <p> Daisies are classic flowers in our culture and vocabulary. The white petals and yellow center of Shasta daisies inspired the typical daisy image.  They have been cultivated in gardens for at least a century.  </p>

<p><em>Leucanthemum vulgare</em>, or Oxeye daisy, moved here from Europe and Asia and has rooted itself along road sides and fields through out the continental U.S.  In the early 1900s Luther Burbank hybridized <em>Leucanthemum maximum</em> and <em>L. lancustre</em> to create the classic <em>Leucanthemum x superbum,</em> or Shasta daisy (named after Mt. Shasta).</p>
<p>Different varieties bloom at different times of the year.  Early varieties generally bloom May through June.  Where as mid and late varieties start in June and bloom into July or August. Many kinds can re-bloom in fall. </p>
   <p>Over the years hybridizers have developed a varieties that grow to different heights, have different flower configurations, have yellow petals, and have reduced odor (this is a good thing).These flowers are perfect for bouquets, flower crowns, billowing cottage gardens, and perennial boarders and attract many pollinators. They pair wonderfully with Foxglove, Delphinium, Daylilies, Nepeta and ornamental grasses.</p>

      <h2>Facts: Leucanthemum  </h2>
      <p><strong>Family:</strong> <em>Asteraceae</em></p>
          <p><strong>Genus:</strong> <em>Leucanthemum</em></p>
          <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Shasta daisy, Ox-Eye daisy</p>
          <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Widely distributed in Europe and Northern Asia.  There are 33 species in the genus.</p>
          <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Rich, moist, well-drained soil. Full to part sun (at least five hours of direct  sun). Double varieties appreciate shade from the intense sun. </p>
          <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Low-maintenance and easy to grow. Shasta daisies should be divided every two to  three years to avoid overcrowding of the crowns. </p>
          <p>Some staking may be needed of taller varieties, or pinch back once or twice in April or May for sturdier (but smaller flowered) plants.</p>
          <p>Dead head the first flush of  flowers to encourage a second bloom. Tall varieties can be pinched back in  April to avoid the need to stake plants later in the season. </p>
