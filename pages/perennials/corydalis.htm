<p>An essential plant for the shady garden, Corydalis offers sprays of cheerful flowers and delicate, beautiful foliage early in the season.</p>
<p>Finding plants that will bloom well in shady conditions can be a bit challenging, but Corydalis will brighten up even a deep shade spot with very little trouble. The lacy, ferny foliage appears in late winter, and clusters of small, tubular, often fragrant flowers cover the plant from early spring into early summer, and sometimes even longer. A great filler or mass-planted ground cover, Corydalis blends beautifully with other early shade-lovers like bleeding hearts, Narcissus, violets, or primroses.</p>

<p>Easy of and reliable bloom are not the only merits of this sweet little plant. Just look at the colors! In addition to lavender and purple, you’ll find cheery bright yellow, pink, white and absolutely true blue. What Corydalis wants is a rich, well-drained soil in a cool spot. It’s primarily a woodland plant, so imagine the fluffy loam of a forest floor. Add plenty of compost to amend the soil, and give it a bit of organic flower food in late winter to keep the blooms coming. Consistent watering is important, but soil should not retain too much water, or the roots could rot.  This is especially important when the plant is dormant in winter or late summer. Corydalis tends to die back to the ground and go dormant when summer temperatures start to get hot, but if it is placed in a cool microclimate with regular water, you may be able to keep it going well into the summer or even into autumn.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Facts:</strong> Corydalis</p>
</div>
<div class="treatment">
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Papaveraceae (sometimes categorized Fumariaceae)</p>
<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Corydalis</p>
<p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Corydalis, fumewort</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> A large genus native to temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere, especially China.</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Plant in part sun to full shade. Morning sun or dappled all-day shade is best. Plant in loamy, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Avoid planting in hot spots in the garden, as Corydalis prefers a cool situation. Needs consistent watering, though Corydalis can’t tolerate poorly drained soils, especially in dormancy. Hardy in zones 5-8.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Easy-care. Regular watering may keep plants from going dormant in the warmer summer months. Some Corydalis, especially yellow varieties (C. lutea), can self-seed prolifically, so keep an eye out for volunteers popping up where you don’t want them to. Divide crowded clumps in the fall or late winter. Transplant carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Additional qualiities:</strong>  Attracts butterflies. Deer resistant. Fragrant flowers. </p>
<p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong> Not usually bothered by pests or diseases. Powdery mildew can sometimes occur. Thin out crowded plants to promote good air circulation.</p>
