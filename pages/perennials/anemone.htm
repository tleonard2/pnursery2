<h2>Facts:ANEMONE</h2>
<p><strong>Genus: </strong>Anemone</p>
<p><strong>Common name(s):</strong> Windflower, Japanese Anemone</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> 120 species from throughout the temperate regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres.</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong> In general Anemone do best in woodland conditions in light, cool, well-draining soil rich in organic matter. If your soil is a little warmer, increase watering slightly. Many species are flexible about soil conditions, but all do require good drainage. Japanese anemones&nbsp;require at least 4 hours of sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>Pests &amp; Diseases:</strong> Largely pest and disease free. Creatures fond of Anemone species include slugs, snails, moth and butterfly larvae. A slug bait such as Sluggo will deter snails and slugs. Products are available that will address the larva if they become an issue, but then you'll have less butterflies later-so that part is really up to you.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Grooming and staking may be necessary. Deadhead to prevent excessive resseding if desired.</p>
<p><strong>Additional qualaties</strong>: Attracts bees, butterflies and benificial insects. &nbsp;Cut flower and long bloom season. &nbsp;Deer resistant. &nbsp;Tolerates moist soil.</p>
<p><strong>Propagation: </strong>For autumn flowering types propagate by root cuttings in spring. Fall transplanting is usually unsuccessful with this type. Young plants or transplants are sometimes slow to get started but are usually abundant and spreading by year three. With spring flowering types divide the tubers once the plant goes dormant for the summer. Seeds are ready to sow as soon as they are ripe.</p>
