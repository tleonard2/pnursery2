<p><em>Anemone</em> is a diverse group of plants offering carpets of woodland delight; bright pops of early spring flowers; and graceful, fluttering blooms in autumn.</p>
<p>The fluffy flowers of <em>A. coronaria</em> offer some of the first rich colors in early spring. These crepe paper like flowers are wonderful in containers or as a little gift that will surely bring a smile. Also in spring, woodland species carpet shady to part sun areas with nickel to quarter sized flowers in shades of white, blue and green. </p>
	<p>These species can spread slowly over time to create a naturalized fairy land. A fun combination is masses of white <em>A. blanda</em> accented with bright tulips. The result is a terrific, florific spring display! Since spring blooming anemone go summer dormant it is best to combine with something that has year round or summer interest such as mondo grass or ferns.</p>

<p>Most recent introductions of the 'Swan Series' offers stunning lavender and white bicolored blooms. This group on anemone bridge the gap with blooms June to frost.</p>
<p>In early autumn, tall stalks of blushed white or pink flowers wave in the breeze. Anemone japonica and hybrids add much needed color to the late season shade garden. The height of taller varieties combines well with low growing <em>Heuchera</em> or evergreen shrubs. Compact varieties can add a floral punch to the boarder where spring blooming perennials are spent.</p>

<h2>Facts:ANEMONE</h2>
<p><strong>Genus: </strong>Anemone</p>
<p><strong>Common name(s):</strong> Windflower, Japanese Anemone</p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> 120 species from throughout the temperate regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres.</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong> In general Anemone do best in woodland conditions in light, cool, well-draining soil rich in organic matter. If your soil is a little warmer, increase watering slightly. Many species are flexible about soil conditions, but all do require good drainage. Japanese anemones require at least 4 hours of sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>Pests &amp; Diseases:</strong> Largely pest and disease free. Creatures fond of Anemone species include slugs, snails, moth and butterfly larvae. A slug bait such as Sluggo will deter snails and slugs. Products are available that will address the larva if they become an issue, but then you'll have less butterflies later-so that part is really up to you.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Grooming and staking may be necessary. Deadhead to prevent excessive resseding if desired.</p>
<p><strong>Additional qualaties</strong>: Attracts bees, butterflies and benificial insects. Cut flower and long bloom season. Deer resistant. Tolerates moist soil.</p>
<p><strong>Propagation: </strong>For autumn flowering types propagate by root cuttings in spring. Fall transplanting is usually unsuccessful with this type. Young plants or transplants are sometimes slow to get started but are usually abundant and spreading by year three. With spring flowering types divide the tubers once the plant goes dormant for the summer. Seeds are ready to sow as soon as they are ripe.</p>
