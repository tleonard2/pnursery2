A bold tropical looking garden is not complete without the big leaves and voluptuous flowers of Cannas. Tall varieties offer a sensational backdrop for just about anything. Dwarf varieties can move into the middle or front layer of the border to offer good substance in the mix of plants.</p><p>Christopher Lloyd taught us to mix Cannas with finer, tall foliage such as <em>Heilanthus angustifolia</em> or ‘Lemon Queen’ and <em>Miscanthus 'Arabesque'</em>&nbsp;for textural contrasts. Cannas also look great alone. &nbsp;A superb tropical container plant, Cannas pair well with papyrus or sweet potato vine. &nbsp;If you plant more tender varieties such as <em>C. australis</em> or Intrigue, it is best to overwinter them in the garage or some sheltered area. &nbsp;</p><p>Cannas also teach us patience. &nbsp;They are one of the last perennials to emerge in the garden and in nurseries. &nbsp;This is because Cannas require heat to wake up. &nbsp;They need at least 6 hours of direct sun, regular water and very good drainage. &nbsp;To insure good drainage, mix an inch of pumice plus compost into the bottom of the hole. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Ponds are another area in which to feature cannas. &nbsp;They can tolerate 4-6" of water over the crown. &nbsp;It is essential to move pond cannas into a dry area for the winter. &nbsp;If your pond has afternoon shade, try Canna 'Stutgart' which has bold variegated leaves.</p><hr><h3><a title="Canna 'Ausrtalia'" href="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/10/16/12/41/canna-lilies-491076_960_720.jpg" data-mce-href="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/10/16/12/41/canna-lilies-491076_960_720.jpg">https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/10/16/12/41/canna-lilies-491076_960_720.jpg</a></h3><h3>Canna 'Australia'</h3><p>Rich burgundy leaves with bright red flowers July to October</p><p>Grow 3-5' tall 30"wide</p><p>Zones 7-10</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><hr></div><div class="col-md-8 left-inner">Please use photo currently on side bar</div><h3 class="col-md-8 left-inner">Canna 'Intrigue'</h3><p>Stunning dusky purple folilage topped by delicate orange flowers&nbsp;</p><p>Grows 5-6' tall and 18-24"wide</p><p>Hardy to zone 8.</p><hr><h3>Canna musifolia, Bananna leaf canna</h3><p>A huge plant with giant&nbsp;leaves in red or green on red stems</p><p>Small red flowers in summer</p><p>Grows 6-12' tall 24"+ wide</p><p>Zones 8-10.</p><hr><h3><a title="Canna 'Pretoria'" href="http://www.monrovia.com/plant-catalog/plants/136/bengal-tiger-canna/" data-mce-href="http://www.monrovia.com/plant-catalog/plants/136/bengal-tiger-canna/">http://www.monrovia.com/plant-catalog/plants/136/bengal-tiger-canna/</a></h3><h3>Canna 'Pretoria' &nbsp;(a.k.a 'Bengal Tiger')<br></h3><p>Striking gold and and green striped leaves</p><p>Huge orange flowers July to October</p><p>Grows 6' tall 24"wide</p><p>Zones 7-11.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><hr><h3 class="col-md-8 left-inner"><a title="Canna 'Tropical Yellow'" href="http://www.monrovia.com/plant-catalog/plants/3297/tropical-yellow-canna/" data-mce-href="http://www.monrovia.com/plant-catalog/plants/3297/tropical-yellow-canna/">http://www.monrovia.com/plant-catalog/plants/3297/tropical-yellow-canna/</a></h3><h3>Canna 'Tropical&nbsp;Series'</h3><p>&nbsp;<br></p>A series of compact cannas growing 2' tall 18-24"wide</div><div class="row">Large flowers come in red, rose, white and yellow.</div><div class="row">Zones 7-11.</div><div class="row"><hr><h3 class="col-md-8 left-inner"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/canna/tropicana360.jpg" alt="Canna Tropicana" width="500" data-mce-src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/canna/tropicana360.jpg"></h3><h3>Canna Tropicana (a.k.a Phasion)</h3><p>Bright rosey red leaves with chocolate and green stripes</p><p>Fluffy orange flowers July to October</p><p>Grows 4-6' tall 24"wide</p><p>Zone 8</p><h3 class="col-md-8 left-inner"><br></h3><!-- col-md-8 left-inner --><div class="col-md-4"><div class="sidebar pull-right">{% partial "sidebar-spring" %}<div class="treatment"><h2>Availability</h2><p>Inventory varies daily. &nbsp;Rhizomes available March-May. &nbsp;Plants May to September. &nbsp;Please contact us for current availability.</p><p>Facts: Canna</p></div><div class="treatment"><p><strong>Genus:</strong> Canna (Ka nuh)</p><p><strong>Common name(s):</strong> Canna Lily, Indian Shot</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> Nine species native to tropical and subtropical New World.</p><p><strong>Culture:</strong> Full sun (at least 5 hours of direct sun), fertile well drained soil, regular water. Cannas can grow around the edges of ponds as long as they are lifted in the fall to prevent rot over the winter. They can grow from 3’ (dwarf varieties) up to 10’ (<em>Canna musifolia</em>) tall and the clumps can creep indefinitely but slowly.</p><p><strong>Pests &amp; Diseases:</strong> Cannas are prone to rot in our soggy winter soils. They are also prone to the usual insects such as aphids and caterpillars. You can get foliage deformities or streaking if there are dramatic temperature changes while the leaves are unfurling. Often positioning cannas near a structure or large plant can help mitigate this situation. Leaf streaking can also be caused by a virus.</p><p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> A relatively low maintenance group of plants if given good drainage. Give plants an all purpose fertilizer in spring as they are emerging. Flowers can be dead headed once the bloom has passed. Cut off the bloom head down to the next leaf.</p><p>A second bloom often emerges at this point. In fall cut canna stalks 1” above the ground after the leaves turn yellow. If they are planted in heavy soil, (or in zone 7 or lower), they should be dug in the fall to prevent rot or freezing out.</p><p>Dig up the entire root mass, leaving as much soil around the roots as possible. The soil should be moist, NOT wet. Let sit a few days if too wet. Put the whole clump inside a large plastic bag. Cover any bare roots or rhizomes with damp peat moss, filling the holes and gaps with the peat.</p><p>Fold the bag loosely closed and store in a cool place, but where the canna roots and rhizomes will not freeze. In the spring, you will notice the clumps start to sprout. If the weather is frost free, this is your sign to plant!</p><p><strong>Additional qualities</strong>: Attracts hummingbirds. Deer resistant. Great in containers.</p><p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Divide in late fall or early spring.</p><!-- side col --></div><!-- treatment --><figure><em><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/canna/canna-flame350.jpg" alt="canna 'Flame'" data-mce-src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/canna/canna-flame350.jpg"></em><figcaption><em>canna 'Flame'</em></figcaption></figure></div><!-- treatment --><figure><em><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/agastache/agastache-flame350.jpg" alt="agastache 'Flame'" data-mce-src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/agastache/agastache-flame350.jpg"></em><figcaption><em>agastache 'Flame'</em></figcaption></figure></div><!-- sidebar pull-right --></div><!-- Right Col --></div><!-- End Row --><div class="row"><em>{% partial "list-perennials" %}</em></div><!-- End Container Content -->
