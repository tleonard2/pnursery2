These plants are native to grasslands, rocky areas, and forests of Australia, New Zealand, and some Pacific Islands. Because they evolved in a much warmer and dryer climate than we have here in the Pacific Northwest, Coprosma is considered borderline hardy here and will need to be protected or moved to a greenhouse for overwintering. &nbsp;</p><p>Coprosma is a fairly quick growing plant that makes a great addition to summer and fall containers. It pairs well with fall colored pansies, dahlias with darker foliage such as Mystic Spirit, or the beautifully orange tinted blades of Carex&nbsp;testacea. &nbsp;In protected areas, or in years with a mild winter, mirror plant can add a splashy evergreen evergreen shrub in borders. &nbsp;</p><h3></h3><h3>Coprosma ‘Rainbow Surprise’</h3><p>Glossy yellow and green leaves splashed with rusty orange add bright color to your fall garden. This compact shrub grows 4-5ft tall and 3-4ft wide. Can tolerate full sun to part shade. Deer resistant.</p><hr><h3>Coprosma ‘Evening Glow'</h3><p>Lovely green leaves with cream edges and a pink blush which turn bright orange in late summer. &nbsp;Grows 4-5' tall 2-3' wide in zones 9-11.<br></p><hr><h3>Coprosma ‘Pina Colada’</h3><p>Striking gold foliage with a dark burgundy edge. &nbsp;Grows 3'tall and wide. &nbsp;Zones 9-11.<br></p><hr><h3>Coprosma ‘Tequila sunrise’</h3><p>Shiny lime green foliage with a darker green mid-rib. Turns orange in fall and continues to darken to burgundy in winter. Stays compact growing to 2’ tall and 2’ wide. Great container plant. Prefers full sun.</p>Coprosma can be found in both upright and creeping varieties. Its flowers are inconspicuous and tubular or narrowly funnel shaped. Male and female flowers grow on separate plants with berries showing on female plants in late summer and autumn. The berries are not poisonous and range in color from vibrant orange and yellow to deeper shades of red or blue.</div><!-- col-md-8 left-inner --><div class="col-md-4"><div class="sidebar pull-right">{% partial "sidebar-spring" %}<div class="treatment"><h2>Availability</h2><p><em>Inventory changes daily late May into September. &nbsp;Please contact us for current availability.</em></p></div><div class="treatment"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/coprosma/tequila-sunrise-mirrorplant235.jpg" alt="Coprosma 'Tequila Sunrise'" width="235" height="340" data-mce-src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/coprosma/tequila-sunrise-mirrorplant235.jpg"><p class="caption">Coprosma ’Tequila Sunrise‘</p><h2>Facts: Coprosma</h2><p><strong>Genus:</strong> Coprosma</p><p><strong>Family:</strong> Rubiaceae</p><p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Mirror Plant</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> Found in forest, swamp, grassland, and rocky areas of Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands.</p><p><strong>Culture:</strong> Grows well in many different soil types but needs good drainage.
